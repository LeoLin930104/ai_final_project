10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0034,"<p>Medical sociology, sometimes referred to as health sociology, is the study of the social causes and consequences of health and illness. Major areas of investigation include the social determinants of health and disease, the social behavior of patients and health care providers, the social functions of health organizations and institutions, the social patterns of the utilization of health services, the relationship of health care delivery systems to other social institutions, and social policies toward health. What makes medical sociology important is the critical role social factors play in determining or influencing the health of individuals, groups, and the larger society. Social conditions and situations not only promote and, in some cases, cause the possibility of illness and disability, but also enhance prospects of disease prevention and health maintenance. The earliest works in medical sociology were carried out by physicians in the United States, not sociologists who tended to ignore the field. This changed in the late 1940s when large amounts of federal funding became available to support joint research projects between sociologists and medical doctors. At its inception, work in medical sociology was oriented toward finding solutions relevant for clinical medicine. However, in 1950, Talcott Parsons, the leading theorist in sociology at that time, introduced his concept of the sick role that subsequently attracted other theoretical work and had an important role in the emergence of medical sociology as an academic field. Medical sociology has evolved to the point today that it investigates health and medical problems from an independent sociological perspective. Medical sociologists now comprise one of the largest and most active groups doing sociological work in North America and Europe, and the field has expanded to other regions as well. About one of every ten American sociologists is a medical sociologist.</p>",sociology

Tourism cannot be treated in isolation since it embodies all tourism practices in a system they operate in. Thus, tourism is a complex sociocultural, economic, and political phenomenon and touches all levels of society. The investigation of tourism’s role in society, the tourism system’s effects on nature, tourism spaces, objects, practices, relationships, and the tourist typologies demand systematic sociological investigations. A researcher needs to consider the whole macro system through its members’ social, political, cultural, and economic interactions. In such a social context, both human and nonhuman actors continuously shape and reshape the tourism system, and the tourism system reshapes these actors’ values, attitudes, and behaviors. Researchers examining the sociology of tourism departed from several theoretical Perspectives, blended theory and method, and focused on sociological concepts to understand and explain the different aspects of tourism. This group of scholars has been working within the several cores of sociology (e.g., education, family, economy, development, religion, gender, language, migration, social inequalities, labor, art) and at the margins of emerging interdisciplinary formations, including those crossing many disciplines such as geography, anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, marketing, communication, women’s studies, history, and cultural studies. The sociology of tourism studies engendered transdisciplinary conversations both in academia and in practice, and the results of these studies have created pragmatic changes in tourism practices, habits, and governance.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0187,"<p>Cognitive sociology is the study of the conditions under which meaning is constituted through processes of reification. Cognitive sociology traces its origins to writings in the sociology of knowledge, sociology of culture, cognitive and cultural anthropology, and more recently, work done in cultural sociology and cognitive science. Its central questions revolve around locating these processes of reification since the locus of cognition is highly contentious. Researchers consider how individuality is related to notions of society (structures, institutions, systems, etc.) and notions of culture (cultural forms, cultural structures, sub-cultures, etc.). These questions further explore how these answers depend on learning processes (socialization, acculturation, etc.) which vary according to the position one takes on the role of language in cognition. It is from these positions that we operationalize a theory of human nature and construct a justification for the organization of the state of human affairs and the related conceptualizations of identity, self, and the subject. In this way, cognitive sociology seeks to establish the minimal model of the actor (the ontology) that underpins not only other subfields of sociology but also the human sciences in general. In this way, cognitive sociology analyzes the series of interpersonal processes that set up the conditions for phenomena to become “social objects,” which subsequently shape thinking and thought. In classical cognitive sociology, the historical traditions of the sociology of knowledge and phenomenology are emphasized, with the work of Bourdieu and Goffman given special treatment, given their contributions as precursors to many of the contemporary contingencies and consequences of debates in culture and cognition. The principle organizing the more contemporary literature are the paradigmatic assumptions concerning the locus of cognition, which have been organized into five ideal-types. These elucidate the points of agreement and disagreement in the field by addressing how thematic concerns (e.g., knowledge, rationality, embodiment, practices, discourse, etc.) highlight the priority of individuality in modeling society, to illustrate what makes cognitive sociology at once interdisciplinary yet contentiously distinct in addressing the politics of “tacit knowledge.”</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0221,"<p>This article curates scholarship around those understandings identified to be “knowledges.” It investigates their production, legitimating institutions, and their experiences and embodiments. It emphasizes those conceptualizations excluded from canonizations of knowledge. This knowledge cultural sociology (KCS) recognizes the importance of the Mannheimian tradition, and its extensions, that explain how social relations shape the articulations and validations of knowledge. However, KCS also situates knowledge within systems beyond those who produce and consume it. KCS views knowledge as itself necessarily contested, as struggles over its qualities reflect social locations and articulate social practices. In making knowledge over the subject of inquiry, KCS works to understand how knowledges’ symbols, schemas, institutions, and networks shape the terms of social reproduction and transformations. As such, KCS demands consideration of different kinds of knowledge cultural products and modes of communication. KCS is thus necessarily grounded in the question of what constitutes knowledge, and for whom and with what interests and expectations. This KCS intervention focuses on 21st-century work. This decision aims to engage scholarship that extends and challenges a 20th-century canon; including works from the 20th century signals scholarship yearning for expansion. The article is not comprehensive, but marks how knowledge is valued and ignored. To focus on this century and move beyond sociology allows engagement with ways of knowing and being that sociology has historically minoritized, moving consideration to structures and processes validating some kinds of knowledge over others. KCS is not canonization, but works toward liberation, a knowledge activism mobilizing knowledge in consequential public ways alongside more familiar scholarly ambitions. KCS moves scholarship beyond familiar networks and self-reproducing knowledge hierarchies grounded in race, gender, sexuality, religion, and world region. It seeks to move dialogue beyond knowledge silos and to identify new and ignored ideas, meanings, references, and authorities for constituting knowledges of consequence, reframing contests along the way. For example, instead of asking how excellence and diversity can be combined in knowledge production, KCS asks what anti-racist knowledge excellence can be. Accounts of epistemology ought to foreground the contexts and power relations in which those knowledge sensibilities are formed and communicated; thus, the references in this article move generally from concept to context. Likewise, sections moving toward global, post-socialist, and postcolonial discussions inform ontologies and epistemologies organizing scholarly work and public consequence. But this begins with what might be identified, in this entry at least, as the greatest hits of KCS.</p>",sociology

The field incorporates insights from economics, behavioral psychology, economic anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Structural and cultural approaches largely characterize the studies conducted in the field, with the former associated with networks, institutions, and social organization; the latter, rituals, symbols, cognitive frameworks, and narratives. Economic sociologists study how social networks and relationships affect economic actions, such as the provision of loans, the acquisition of a job, and the successful construction of deals. Empirical studies examine how prices are set, why some pricing schemes that do not seem rational are instead understandable and predictable, and how markets are incorporated into social life, and vice versa.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0154,"<p>Rural sociology is a unique area of sociological inquiry. Its institutional development leaves it perhaps the most independent of all sociological subfields. Rural sociology in the United States emerged in the early 20th century when federal funding was earmarked to the land grant universities (public universities) to study and assist the farm population. Separate “rural” sociology departments appeared gradually within colleges of agriculture that paralleled the substantive areas found in general sociology departments. Thus, one finds in rural sociology a replication of many core areas in general sociology but with a rural twist—inequality, demography, work/labor markets, race/ethnicity, gender, community, and so forth. Over time, additional rural-oriented specialty areas emerged, notably the sociology of agriculture and natural resource/environmental sociology. Rural sociology has also expanded globally. As a consequence, the substantive scope of contemporary research is large and varied. What knits the work together is a focus on the geographic periphery, that is, the places, populations, and forms of social activity found in rural areas globally which has provided boundary and meaning to the field. In addition to its broad substantive scope, rural sociology is characterized by a distinct research approach. Research tends to be comparative: rural places and populations are often set in contrast with regard to their urban counterparts to ascertain similarities and differences. In this way, rural sociological research is often said to challenge the urban bias of general sociology. Disciplinary practice is also distinct. While there are few departments with rural sociology in their name today, courses and specializations in the field are found across many land grant universities. There is a long tradition of cross-disciplinary linkages particularly with agricultural economics, the environmental sciences, and more recently geography. Rural sociologists have been highly active in federal, state, and local public policy circles and in public sociology efforts that contribute to community development, sustainable agricultural and food systems, and social and environmental justice. In terms of work in the profession, rural sociologists also work outside of colleges of agriculture, within government agencies, international development agencies, and across governmental and non-governmental institutions. Although rural populations will continue to decline globally, there is reason to think that rural sociology will have broad influence in the future because the research areas it encompasses are of growing interest to social scientists, policymakers, and the public at large. Issues addressed by rural sociologists pertaining to the sustainability of the food system, climate/environmental change, and rural poverty are among the most pressing public concerns today.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0009,"<p>Comparative historical sociology is the branch of sociology that analyzes society-wide transformations, such as social revolutions, the rise of capitalism and the nation-state, democratization, and the birth and transformation of welfare states. At the end of the 19th century all of sociology’s European founders turned to historical explanation to understand the changes that capitalism had brought to their societies, from Marx’s attempt to explain history as the working out of class struggle, to Weber’s investigations into the comparative development of economy and society, to Durkheim’s investigations into the historical development of religion, law, and the division of labor. These early historical arguments were eclipsed, however, by the behavioral revolution and the explosion of statistical tools and techniques of the mid-20th century, which re-founded the discipline as the study of large numbers of individual actors or units. Only when revolutions and social change became increasingly pressing political concerns in the 1960s and 1970s did a large number of scholars once again turn to comparative historical sociology as the form of sociological explanation most appropriate to analyzing changes that occur infrequently or over very long periods, and that affect a society as a whole unit. While the classics of the discipline focus on European history, contemporary scholars are extending the approach to the rest of the world. Current areas of great interest include the question of why China did not experience an industrial revolution in the 18th century, the role of the state in economic development, and the transition to capitalism in eastern Europe. Some think that the study of rare events requires different methods from those common in the rest of sociology, and accordingly a lively methodological discussion is underway in the field. Because there has been great interest in the state as the source of much social transformation, the subfield overlaps considerably with macro political sociology; but comparative historical scholars are also interested in processes of social and economic change beyond the realm of the political.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0198,"<p>Music is central to cultural life and therefore also often perceived as central to social life. The study of music in society has been of interest to canonic social thinkers, including Weber, Simmel, and Adorno, since the establishment of sociology. The study of music has also concerned scholars in adjacent disciplines, particularly musicology, cultural studies, and economics. In the landmark Distinction, Bourdieu argued, “nothing more clearly affirms ones ‘class,’ nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music” (Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste [London: Routledge, 1984], p. 18). Sociologists of music have accordingly been concerned with the importance of musical taste for signifying status and distinguishing cultural hierarchies. Sociologists have also been concerned with the socio-demographic correlates of musical preference, how musicians and the music industry organize to provide music and influence taste, and the education and working conditions of musicians. What tends to distinguish sociology of music from other disciplines is a commitment to the sociological imagination or the use of social research methods—but not necessarily both. And many sociologists of music work across disciplines. Sociologists have also coalesced around the study of different genres, and those contributing in the sociology of particular genres often do so not as sociologists but as music, folklore, or history scholars whose interests have extended to the sociology of music. The American sociology of music tradition has arguably been influenced more heavily by symbolic interactionism and rational choice theory than the European, where critical theory has been more influential. Nevertheless, conceptual and methodological interchange is growing, particularly with the increasing influence of Bourdieu in US sociology. The sociology of race, gender, and sexuality has also influenced the field significantly. This conceptual and methodological diversity means the field has low paradigmaticness. However, this diversity does lead to productive exchange and synthesis of ideas and methods. Notably, there is growing interest in music as a social technology and insights from science and technology studies. As in cultural sociology more broadly, attention is turning to “the music itself,” music as mediating social interaction, and artists and works embedded in wider socio-musical systems using computational tools, particularly network analysis. Data proliferation is generating innovative quantitative work. Qualitative research is also being reinvigorated by new technologies enabling new interview methods, digital ethnography, and computational methods for processing textual data.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0055,"<p>Culture is the symbolic-expressive dimension of social life. In common usage, the term “culture” can mean the cultivation associated with “civilized” habits of mind, the creative products associated with the arts, or the entire way of life associated with a group. Among sociologists, “culture” just as often refers to the beliefs that people hold about reality, the norms that guide their behavior, the values that orient their moral commitments, or the symbols through which these beliefs, norms, and values are communicated. The sociological study of culture encompasses all these diverse meanings of “culture.” Amid this diversity, what unifies the sociology of culture are two core commitments: that the symbolic-expressive dimension of social life is worthy of examination, both for its own sake and because of its impact on other aspects of social life; and that culture can be studied using the methods and analytic tools of sociology. Within the discipline, the sociology of culture emerged as a bounded subfield during the 1980s. Prior to this period, sociological analyses of culture were found mainly in theoretical treatises and in empirical studies of religion, the arts, and the “sociology of knowledge.” Throughout, the sociological study of culture has been oriented by a common set of broad questions: What are the social origins of culture? What cultural patterns are found in various groups and institutions? And what influence does culture have on important aspects of society? Scholarship in the sociology of culture ranges from highly general conceptual arguments to closely observed empirical studies. The readings included here reflect this breadth.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0161,"<p>The sociology of war is a subfield of sociology that focuses on the macro-level patterns of war making, how societies engage in warfare, the meaning that war has in society, and the relationship between state structure and war making. A related subfield is military sociology, which focuses more explicitly on the organization and functioning of military forces and civil- military relations. These lines of scholarship are bound together by the basic premise that understanding war necessitates understanding those who fight it, and vice versa. The sociology of war overlaps with other fields that share an interest in government and politics, such as military history, political sociology, political science, and international relations. However, these fields tend to be concerned primarily with how wars begin and end, whereas the sociology of war tends to focus more explicitly on the cultural and social implications of war and how war and society act and react upon each other. With a few notable exceptions, the sociology of war remained mostly isolated within the field of comparative historical sociology until the 1980s, when two trends opened the door for an interdisciplinary sociology of war. The first was the dissipation of a war taboo, widespread in American academia and connected to the social resistance against the Vietnam War throughout the 1960s and 1970s. A renewed interest in the social implications of war also occurred as the end of the Cold War raised new questions about the role of the state in war making and the future of warfare. Renewed interdisciplinary interest in the origins of the modern nation-state led to a reexamination of the role that warfare played in the emergence and spread of the state system. In the decade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2011 the sociology of war focused extensively on questions related to the role of nonstate combatant groups, the apparent increase in asymmetrical war in the post–Cold War era, and the meaning that such transformations in war making may carry for the societies that wage them. As the Global War on Terror nears the end of its second decade, scholars have increasingly turned their attention to understanding the interactions between state and society as the lines between peacetime and wartime become less distinguishable. Most recently, the sociology of war has exhibited a broadening in scope, with greater emphasis on examining how war is situated within larger patterns of social violence.</p>",sociology

Through the examples of sociologists working in the Chicago Tradition, French sociologists working with Pierre Bourdieu, and other examples from American sociology, I show that sociological work is group activity. It is argued in this paper, that to make sociological thinking understandable to students teachers may do well to contextualize key theorists in their narrative/biographical context.

Yet, while one can find two modern traditions of research concentrated around the concepts of values and morality in sociology, the strict relations between them are rarely explicitly addressed. In this article, we aim to analyze the concepts of values and morality as used in sociological theory and research, specifying the core meanings and contexts in which sociologists employ either of them. Based on this, we propose four analytical optics – empirical vs theoretical emphasis, moral vs non-moral values, bottom-up vs top-down approach, realism vs relativism – that help clarify the crucial features of the two strands in comparison to each other while suggesting the ways by which they may further complement each other.",sociology

The enormity of the suffering has led to an interest in fascism and its origins, with the hope that understanding what it is and why it occurred will prevent it from happening again. The sociological study of fascism is historical, interdisciplinary, and comparative. A key feature of the scholarship is the debate about fascism’s definition. Because it was the world’s first fascist regime, some claim that the characteristics of Italian fascism under Mussolini should form the basis for the definition, or that Italian fascism is the only instance of fascism. Others argue that the political ideologies and groups that marked the first half of the 20th century had a number of features in common and that, although fascism played out differently in national contexts, a generic definition is possible. Recent scholarship points to a consensus in favor of a generic definition. Fascism promised a solution to the divisions and decay wrought by liberal democracy and communism through mass mobilization, national cleansing, and national rebirth. Roger Griffin said fascism was “palingenetic populist ultranationalism” (Griffin 1993, p. 26, cited under Definitions). Whether fascism manifests as an intellectual current, social movement, political party, or regime also figures in its definition because fascism’s form affects what it can do. Some comparative research focuses on differences between fascism and other authoritarian, conservative, or right-wing groups, as well as relations between fascists and these groups. Since the rebirth that fascism promises usually entails controlling biological and cultural reproduction, women’s roles in fascist ideology and regimes have been the subject of recent studies. Scholars have also likened fascism to religion, for its reliance on myths, symbols, rituals, and commemoration in both ideology and practice, and have studied fascism as an example of totalitarianism, often in comparison to communist Russia. Debates about the definition of fascism are inextricably linked to theories of its emergence. Some scholars explain fascism’s origins by looking at intellectual, cultural, political, or economic factors. Others claim that the only way to understand why fascism occurred is to study its leaders and their intentions (e.g., Adolf Hitler), and its members, voters, and supporters. The definition of fascism and its organizational form also affect which countries are studied, whether for case or comparative analysis. Italy and Germany have received the most attention, but many other countries are the subject of inquiry too. Some scholars have examined dozens of countries in an effort to classify them as fascist or otherwise. The scope of fascist studies expands as new insights emerge, as more disciplines become involved, as new methods of inquiry are developed, and as new sources of data become available, such as archives in Russia, eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Vatican. Finally, many scholars are preoccupied by the possibility of fascism’s return in today’s far right in countries all over the world. These are studies for which questions about definition and origins are also important, but perhaps more pressing are concerns about the activities of these groups and whether they pose a threat to democracy and, if so, how to contain them.</p>",sociology

Broadly, sociolinguists investigate the relationship between social context and language structure or use on the assumption that aspects of structure and use require reference to social context for their description and explanation. In practice, the “socio-“of sociolinguistics can refer to three things, separately or in combination: an act or action of language use that requires, minimally, two people for its performance or one person acting as two; language use that is connected to the identity or identities, be they achieved or attributed, of a speaker or speakers; and/or language use that is involved in the expression of ideology. Using these three types of social facts, we may ask how researchers find the social in a sociolinguistic analysis of structure and use. We suggest here that sociolinguists use three fundamental approaches. Each involves a positioning of the social with respect to the linguistic or the linguistic with respect to the social. These approaches are: Constraint Approach: One may find the social as extra-linguistic constraints or conditions on use of competing forms. Indexicality Approach: One may find the social as indexed by structures/forms, codes (styles, dialects, languages), or acts. Discursive Construction Approach: One may find the social in the explicit and inferrable details of collaborative, sequential, discursive construction. Because the Indexical and Discursive Construction approaches overlap, we will present selected readings in two broad categories. In the first, we will focus on research in Variationist Sociolinguistics which most aptly illustrates the Constraint Approach. However, in Variationist work, the Indexical Approach also appears within research into the Social Meanings of variation. In turn, we will review key publications in socially informed discourse analysis which further illustrate both the Indexical and Discursive Construction Approaches.</p>",sociology

For social scientists, a critical approach to historic preservation means to interrogate the underlying assumptions about history, community, and culture that drive preservation contests as well as the sociospatial outcomes: how places are made, branded, and changed as a result of historic preservation. A number of key questions can be raised about any given preservation effort: What kinds of claims are being made when mnemonic activists declare a building or a neighborhood to be “historic”? Whose vision of history is being wielded when monuments and other spaces of consecration are laid down in the urban fabric? What are the cultural frames that are mobilized to socially construct such landscapes as “historic” versus those are simply “historical”? What are the debates that ensnare all kinds of social actors—urban planners and historians, community activists and politicians—in decisions about which historical landscapes to conserve, and which to leave as unprotected commodities?

In order to situate the idea of financialisation in a sociological context, I show how the financial crisis of 2007-2008 gave weight to the weightless fictitious capital of the fully financialised world in the form of the dead weight of debt that crushes the indebted and creates a new power relation, which Maurizio Lazzarato writes of in terms of the creditor / debtor relation. While economics tends to conceive of debt in terms of number and objective mathematical calculation, the idea of the weight of debt focus upon the subjective experience of indebtedness founded upon a particular subordinate subject position, the debtor, which it then becomes possible to understand sociologically and critically oppose on the basis of different value systems.</p>",sociology

Previously, studies of food production and consumption typically fell under the purview of research on health, agrarian studies, development sociology, agricultural economy, or social anthropology. Rural and natural resource sociologists especially have long emphasized the management and impacts of food production systems in their work. In classical tomes food was typically mentioned as an example of social classification or of social problems rather than a distinct object of study. Since the 1980s sociologists’ attention to how food strengthens social ties; marks social and cultural differences; and is integrated into social organizational forms, ranging from households to empires, has grown. Early-21st-century interest in food by both researchers and the larger public follows heightened awareness of the global character of markets and politics, concerns with health and safety, and the ways cooking and dining out have become fodder for media spectacle. Today sociologists of food display considerable diversity in their theoretical approaches, research methods, and empirical foci. Sociologists draw upon both classic and contemporary sociological theorists to study food’s production, distribution, and consumption as well as how food and eating are integrated into social institutions, systems, and networks. Topically, sociologists contribute to research on inequality and stratification, culture, family, markets, politics and power, identity, status, social movements, migration, labor and work, health, the environment, and globalization. Sociological work on food in the late 20th and early 21st centuries is characterized by two overlapping threads: food systems (derived in part from scholarship on agricultural production and applied extension as well as environmental, developmental, and rural sociology) and food politics, identity, and culture (which reveals social anthropological and cultural-historical undertones). Both are nested in the emerging interdisciplinary research field of food studies, which has gained greater institutional footholds at universities in Europe and Australia than in the United States and Canada (but this may be changing). Sociologists working across the two threads examine issues of food and inequality, trade, labor, power, capital, culture, and technological innovation.

It can be construed as a philosophy, an ideology, a political party, a movement, a disposition, a mode of discourse, performance style, and an emotional relationship to the political. Since the birth of modern democracies in the aftermath of the French Revolution, it has become commonplace to describe the range of political options available to the citizenry as occupying a spectrum from left to right, with a range of alternatives between the extreme poles, including a centrist position in the middle that straddles the divide. The left was associated with promoting challenges to established authorities and existing hierarchies, along with calls for increased economic equality and expanded social and political rights to all citizens, including the heretofore marginalized. This contrasts with the right, which was defined as defending inequalities and differential entitlements, concentrating matters involving rights around preserving property rights, shoring up public and social order, and promoting traditional values and conventional social relations. In this context, liberalism became a mark of political identity associated with the left, as did socialism, while conservatism, broadly construed, represented the right. This framing of politics also includes the possibility of underminings by extremism on both the left and right. For the former, the main threat since the Russian Revolution has been posed by revolutionary communism, while right-wing extremism has manifested itself in reactionary movements, including fascism and illiberal populism. Since liberalism and conservatism must be understood in relational terms, the spatial and temporal settings for the politics of opposition will vary considerably. It is impossible to do justice to the vast literature on conservatism in a bibliography such as this. What follows is a more delimited, and thus manageable examination of work on conservatism. First, it focuses on conservatism in the United States, and not elsewhere. Second, it is chiefly concerned with conservatism since the end of World War II. Third, it concentrates on the study of conservatism by sociologists and those working in cognate disciplines; while not all the authors are card-carrying sociologists, their works reflect a sociological character, although the exception to this third point is the overview section, which presents key readings by advocates of conservatism, and thus offers insider depictions of the meaning of conservatism. Fourth, this article does not concentrate solely on extremist right-wing movements; rather, in surveying the relevant literature on American conservatism broadly construed, it points to a growing consensus that the radical right wing has pushed mainstream conservatism increasingly further to the right.</p>",sociology

This understanding of consumption reflects a utilitarian, economic approach to consumption that should be seen as a starting point, since the range of theoretical and empirical innovations within the field of consumption studies—which exists within sociology, as well as having disciplinary expressions within anthropology, history, geography, business, and marketing studies—has established an understanding of consumption as a complex, widespread process. “The Sociology of Consumption” by Colin Campbell in Daniel Miller, ed., Acknowledging Consumption: A Review of New Studies (London: Routledge, 1995) adds a number of other stages to this basic definition of consumption. Campbell states that consumption involves not just purchasing or using a good or service but also selecting it, maintaining it, possibly repairing it, and ultimately, disposing of it in some way. Within each of these stages there are a number of complex subprocesses that consumption studies scholars have increasingly paid attention to. For example, the selection of goods is sometimes undertaken largely subconsciously or automatically but also based upon various social norms, cultural learning, emotional factors, prejudices, facets of identity, taste, or style. Likewise, disposing of a good may mean literally throwing it away, or it may mean reselling it, donating it, or passing it on to others. Campbell’s definition usefully shows how consumption is a process over time that fuses practical, emotional, material, and economic factors, rather than merely the moment when a person pays for something over the counter. In many ways, this broader understanding of consumption points to a range of innovations within the field that have occurred in the last few decades, which in turn direct us to broader changes in patterns of sociological inquiry. Questions of labor, industry, production units, social, legal, and economic institutions, technology, and social class were the core stuff of social inquiry through much of the 20th century. In mainstream sociology, consumption was for most of the discipline’s history simply not a relevant analytic category, which explains why for much of sociology’s history consumption was understood through theories of capitalist production. However, in the last few decades researchers have increasingly situated practices of consumption and a consumerist ethic as central for understanding broader social and cultural change, impacting on the way sociologists have conceptualized such diverse areas of social change as cultural and economic inequality, urban and spatial development, identity and selfhood, gender relations and performativity, media, and advertising.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0036,"<p>Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the study of knowledge, with knowledge traditionally defined as justified true belief. Classical epistemology set up a dualism between the mind and a material reality external to the mind. The problem to solve then became that of explaining how ideas in the mind could be known to mirror objects outside the mind. For the rationalist tradition, the solution to this problem lay in arguing that the mind had a priori ideas, meaning ideas that existed independently of experience. For the empiricist tradition, the solution to this problem lay in arguing that the mind had a posteriori ideas, meaning ideas stemming from experience or, more precisely, sense data inputs. Alternative positions could adhere to some form of idealism or skepticism. With idealism, reality becomes defined in terms of our ideas of it, and with skepticism it is held that knowledge cannot be attained because we can never know if our ideas mirror objects outside our minds. Later, philosophical attention turned from the issue of discussing whether or not ideas in the mind could mirror objects outside the mind to language. Debates then ensued about whether truth was a matter of correspondence between a statement and a fact. Philosophers concerned with scientific knowledge addressed the issue of what method defined science. For many, there could be a sociology of error but not a sociology of knowledge. What this meant was that while a diligent application of the scientific method would explain the production of truth, error could be explained by “social factors” distorting this process. Examples of social factors could be religious or political commitments. In sociology, epistemology is not a clearly defined topic. Instead, there are a broad range of issues, which may be summarized with the following questions: Should sociology seek scientific knowledge and, if so, how is science to be defined? Can qualitative research give explanatory knowledge of relations of cause and effect as well as quantitative research? Should sociology reject any attempt to explain relations of cause and effect, on the basis that social reality does not have law-like phenomena, in order to understand the shared meanings of agents? How can theoretical abstractions be justified? Should sociologists adopt a broad definition of knowledge to include agents’ understanding of the social and political world, irrespective of whether agents’ beliefs are actually true? Should all domains of knowledge, including the knowledge produced by the natural sciences, be regarded as influenced by sociocultural factors or even completely relative to the prevailing sociohistorical environment? Should value judgments influence the production and dissemination of sociological knowledge? Has sociological knowledge contributed to the reproduction of inequalities by ignoring women and using a research process that is ultimately hierarchical and oppressive? Is a canon of classical texts of any intellectual use for the production of contemporary sociological knowledge? In other words, the issues concerning epistemology in sociology pertain to the status and range of sociological knowledge.</p>",sociology

(Indeed, for several decades the field seemed so innovative that it was regularly termed the “new” social history.) The field has two foci. First, social history emphasizes large numbers of people in the past, rather than just elites or leading individuals. Common categories include social classes, Gender, Race and ethnic group, and age. Social historians see the history of ordinary people as contributing greatly to an understanding of the past, and often they argue that ordinary people display more independent initiative than was commonly assumed by conventional historians. Often some tension emerges between a focus on groups of ordinary people as targets of mistreatment and the claims of more active agency. Second, and closely linked originally to the focus on ordinary people, social historians analyze a variety of aspects of human and social behavior. They reject the tendency of conventional historians to concentrate heavily on formal politics, diplomacy, and great ideas alone. This aspect of social history has expanded steadily. It leads to a host of subfields, including family and childhood, leisure and consumerism, health and disease, and crime, and the list continues to grow as historians respond to changing social patterns and needs. Some tension has developed between interest in a wider range of topics and the earlier commitment to ordinary people, as some new topics are best explored, at least initially, through elite or middle-class sources. Social history’s topical range has also fueled complaints about a lack of overall coherence, though social historians frequently organize their many topics around major developments like industrialization. Many historians identified themselves strongly as social historians during the early decades of the field’s emergence. This singular identification has softened over time, and many historians in the early 21st century “do” social history as part of a larger commitment, usually to a geographical region. Social history has also drawn different levels of attention in various world regions. The field is better developed, for example, in China or the West than in the Middle East. Finally, social historical work has often, but not always, developed with some interdisciplinary connections, particularly to historical sociology.</p>",sociology

The former involves the explanatory stance that one takes to understanding Canada. The latter addresses the significant social dimensions that underlie Canadian social organization, culture, and behavior. I make a case for a<jats:italic>Canadian Sociology</jats:italic>that focuses on the unique features of Canadian society rather than adopting a comparative perspective. I also argue that there is a continuing need within the<jats:italic>Sociology of Canada</jats:italic>to address the issues of staples development. However, I argue that “new” staples analysis must have a directional change from that of the past, in that social processes now largely determine the pattern of staples development. Moreover, new staples analysis must include issues that were never part of earlier staples analysis, such as issues of environmental impacts and of staples depletion under conditions, such as climate change. The paper concludes by analyzing four factors that provide the dominant social contexts for analyzing modern staples development: (1) the rise of neoliberal government, (2) the implementation of globalization and its social consequences, (3) the assumption of aboriginal rights and entitlement, and (4) the rise of environmentalism. These factors were generally not considered in earlier staples approaches. They are critical to understanding the role of staples development and its impact on Canada in the present time.Cet article est une version quelque peu révisé du cours pour le “prix pour contributions exceptionnelles” de l'auteur, présenté à la réunion annuelle de la Société Canadienne de Sociologie à Victoria, Colombie‐Britannique le 6 juin 2013.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0138,"<p>Gender stratification refers to the social ranking, where men typically inhabit higher statuses than women. Often the terms gender inequality and gender stratification are used interchangeably. There are a variety of approaches to the study of gender stratification. Most of the research in this area focuses on differences between men’s and women’s life circumstances, broadly defined. Scholarly debates focus on which dimensions of inequalities are most relevant and the level at which inequalities are generated and maintained (i.e., individual, couple, family, group, or societal level). Researchers have been challenged to explore gender, race, and class inequalities from an intersectional perspective, rather than treating gender as independent of race and class. There is little acknowledgment of the heteronormativity that is present in gender stratification research. Perhaps that will change once data regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression becomes more widely available. In this section, we present key areas of gender stratification research. Gender stratification can be examined at the level of individual outcomes and interactions or with a macro perspective that compares indexes of gender inequalities across countries. Although welfare states research examines many aspects within and across societies, it provides important insights in how state policies can shape patterns of gender stratification. Gender inequality in the area of education, economic resources, and family are closely linked in individuals’ lives, but distinct strands of research have emerged and will be discussed separately. Although we provide examples of research noting gendered health disparities are outcomes of gender inequalities within societies, not all health research makes this connection. Research on crime as well as migration and citizenship has traditionally focused on men. Yet a recent shift to include women more explicitly and gender more broadly has great potential to inform other areas of research on gender stratification.</p>",sociology

Usually supported in research institutions as a core component of the discipline of sociology, social theory most commonly encompasses the range of explanatory concepts, analytical tools, and heuristic devices on which sociologists and social scientists draw in their efforts to interpret statistical or qualitative data about particular empirical social phenomena. Social theory in this relatively narrowly delimited sense is usually thought of as more or less synonymous with the term “sociological theory.” But many common understandings of the scope of the field also imply a wider range of reference than this. Social theory can name general sources of ideas about social phenomena relevant to other disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, such as anthropology, political science, economics, history, cultural and media studies, and gender studies. And social theory can also be thought of as incorporating normative concerns bearing on debates about desirable ends or values of social life—about how social life ideally “ought to be”—in ways that overlap closely with concerns in the fields of moral, political, and legal philosophy. As social theory in most of its central concerns names only a practice of systematic theoretical thinking relevant to particular substantive problems or questions in sociology and other social-science disciplines, some headings in this bibliographical survey of the field will be found to overlap thematically with other Oxford Bibliographies entries in sociology. For more detailed surveys of substantive areas in the Oxford Bibliographies listing with prominent theoretical components see especially: Comparative Historical Sociology, Chicago School of Sociology, World-Systems Analysis, Marxist Sociology, Feminist Theory, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Postmodernity, Symbolic Interactionism, and Michel Foucault. The emphasis of the survey that follows falls primarily on currents and schools of thought in Western social theory from the 18th century to the present day.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0059,"<p>Anarchism developed as a distinctive strain within radical and revolutionary thought in the mid-19th century. The political theory, often associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (b. 1809–d. 1865), Michael Bakunin (b. 1814–d. 1876), and Peter Kropotkin (b. 1842–d. 1921), appeared in parallel with a worldwide, international movement that shaped anarchist practices and that gave expression to a critique of capitalist exploitation, state tyranny, and an idea of rebelliousness that has been influential in sociopolitical, economic, and cultural realms. Contemporary anarchists argue about both the continuities and the discontinuities between the historical and modern movements and the antecedents of European anarchism, but there is a strong consensus that anarchism cannot be reduced to a single set of principles, conceptual arrangements, or theoretical positions that might be applied in practice, analysis, or critique. Because canonical approaches to the history of anarchist ideas are typically resisted, and because the ideological boundaries of anarchism remain contested, anarchist approaches to sociological issues are distinguished by their diversity and are difficult to pin down. However, the anarchists’ traditional opposition to processes associated with state formation, and their interrogation of the complex relationships between these processes and capitalism, society, technology, and culture, are important frames for the discussion of perennial themes, notably, domination, organization, and transformation. Reflections on the rise of the modern European state and the possibility of nonstate organization have long encouraged an interest in anthropology, supporting strongly normative accounts of mutuality, cooperation, and reciprocity. In the anticapitalist mainstream, anarchism supports a rich tradition of thinking about self-regulation, self-management, and decentralized federation. The anarchists’ principled rejection of authority has fostered an interest in systems of education, law, punishment, concepts of crime, and the institutionalization of love in heterosexual relationships, generating cultural practices and literatures that are at once subversive and utopian. Anarchist utopianism is in turn an important strain in urban design, art, and ecology. The anarchist eschewal of institutional politics and advocacy of direct action have focused attention on issues of struggle, protest, and violence as well as the theorization of direct action and prefigurative change. Notwithstanding anarchist suspicions of the elitism and complicity of academic institutions, anarchism has had an influence on mainstream sociology and is equally influenced by critical strains within it. The relationship with Marxism, though often unhappy, has provided one route into sociology. Max Weber’s engagements with anarchism have provided another; and, in late-20th- and early-21st-century history, anarchists have begun to develop approaches to sociology that resonate with both traditions.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0029,"<p>Genocide is now understood as a major type of collective violence, with a distinctive place in the spectrum of political violence, armed conflict, and war, of which it is usually seen as a part. However the idea of genocide dates only from the 1940s, when in the space of four years after its introduction (in a critique of Nazi occupation policies during the Second World War), it became the subject of a major international convention. The concept quickly become central to political and cultural discourses about violence, but the developed academic study of the phenomenon took some decades to develop, before finally taking off around the end of the Cold War. The rapidly expanding field is interdisciplinary, with major contributions from historians, sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, legal scholars, and others. It has highly contested parameters, including the definition of the phenomenon, the universe of cases, the appropriate explanatory frameworks, and so on. It is also considerably politicized, with significant disagreements over how the academic study of genocide should be related to the development of international policies for its prevention. The field’s growth came initially through the extension of understandings of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, which by the late 20th century was known as “the Holocaust,” to other cases, both historic (such as the Ottoman extermination of the Armenians) and contemporary (such as the Cambodian and Rwandan genocides). However, it has since expanded to consider phenomena quite different from the Holocaust in scale and form, such as the diverse and long-drawn-out pattern of genocide during European colonization of the non-Western world. At the same time, the transformations of political violence and war in the post–Cold War world have led to new divergences over the applicability of the genocide idea to recent events. Recent cases, such as the former Yugoslavia, have raised questions about the relationships of population removal and sexual violence to genocide. Because of these tensions, the growth of the field has been accompanied by theoretical, paradigm, and political differences. This bibliography attempts to capture these features of a fast-moving academic field and to provide the reader with a way to explore its essential literature.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0262,"<p>Sociology has an oddly imperfect, even problematic, relationship with public space (and space in general). Taking public space to mean any site that is, at least in principle, open and commonly accessible to all, it is of course the location for an enormous amount of all social interactions that occur outside of the intimacy of home or the professional context of work. It is the stage on which Goffman’s actors perform their presentations of self. From Simmel’s Metropolis and Mental Life through the research of the early Chicago School to countless contemporary ethnographies, urban space in particular is central to sociology. So much of social life takes place on streets or plazas, in public libraries, markets, and subway cars, or in so-called third spaces like cafes and pubs (public houses, after all). Public spaces have countless social characteristics and sociological implications. And yet relatively little sociological research focuses on public space itself, often relegating it at best to context—a crucial variable perhaps, certainly often a field site and the setting for a study, but rarely the object of analysis. Some sociologists who have followed a “spatial turn” are in truth interdisciplinarians by training (e.g., Herbert Gans, Neil Brenner); others began as sociologists and wound up rather outside of the discipline altogether (e.g., William H. Whyte). Still, public space is a natural domain of social research and ought to be a comfortable home to the sociologist. Whether for the pioneering community studies of the 20th century or today’s graduate students conducting surveys and observing daily life, the street corner, the park, the library are essential elements of study.</p>",sociology

This wide usage does not, however, mean that “class” is always defined in consistent ways by sociologists, or that it is necessarily among the most important factors in accounting for any particular social phenomena. There are two features that all conceptualizations of class share. The first is that societies are organized unequally in a vertical fashion, with some people at the top possessing more power, income and wealth, and privileges than people at the bottom. These advantages (or disadvantages) are rooted (at least in part) in the economic relationships between individuals and households. Exactly how classes are defined and categorized, however, remains contested. Second, all class theories start from the proposition that the types of class relationships found in any society matter for other social processes. At the micro level, class location of individuals or households predicts such things as income and wealth, social and political attitudes, marriage, friendships and social networks, voting behavior, cultural consumption, and life chances. At the macro level, class power influences policy and political outcomes, as well as social movement organizations and capacities.</p>",sociology
10.1177/003803857901300102,"The theme of this paper is that the content, form, location and social role of utopia vary with the material conditions in which people live. These variations have been obscured by definitions of utopia in terms of its function in catalysing social change, which has also produced the illusion that the contemporary Western world lacks utopias. By defining utopia with reference to its meaning to author and audience as an expression of their desires and aspirations, it is possible to trace a series of shifts in the English utopia, to relate these to one another and to the social context, and to show that the `absence' of contemporary utopias is simply another transformation of this kind. From being a spatially-located wish-fantasy, utopia moved through the function of social criticism to being a temporally-located catalyst of social change. These changes depended on perceptions of society-in-time as increasingly malleable and open to human control, culminating in the nineteenth century belief in progress. Utopia now appears to have reverted to the role of wish-fantasy as a result of a prevalent fatalism and a shift away from an evolutionary perspective, a change which, paradoxically, allows it to be more utopian by tying it less closely to reality. Utopia as a catalyst of social change depends on an optimism which is now absent.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0134,"<p>The term cultural omnivorousness was first introduced to the cultural consumption literature by Richard Peterson in 1992 (see Peterson 1992 [cited under Reference Texts]) to refer to a particular cultural appreciation profile. According to his definition, this profile emerged in the late 20th century, in accordance with macro changes experienced in the socioeconomic and political spheres. Omnivorous consumers have an increased breadth of cultural taste and a willingness to cross established hierarchical cultural genre boundaries. In other words, the concept refers to a taste profile that includes both highbrow and lowbrow genres. Peterson’s initial studies—with Kern and Simkus—used data on tastes in music in the United States. Later, especially after researchers in Europe developed an interest in the term, many other cultural consumption domains were analyzed to see whether highbrow taste profiles tend to become less exclusive. This interest has been so consistent that we now have sufficient empirical and theoretical research to label the discussion a coherent sociological “debate.” The relationship between omnivorous orientation and variables such as education, age, gender, class, ethnicity, and race has been analyzed in many different national contexts and cultural fields. The omnivore thesis is extremely important for contemporary cultural theory because it pushes researchers to scrutinize the current status of the relationship between culture and power. The contributors to this debate have provided competing answers to the following crucial questions: What is the strength and direction of the association between socioeconomic status and cultural taste? Are we witnessing the decomposition of cultural-class boundaries and snobbishness? How far does cultural omnivorousness bring tolerance and cultural inclusion? These questions, asked within the debate, demonstrate the concept’s significance for our understanding of sociocultural change. Many case studies have shown that eclectic repertoires are more likely to be embodied by the educated middle classes. Peterson himself argued that the employment market has begun to seek this kind of wide-ranging awareness and cultural inclusiveness. It seems that being a true omnivore requires certain skills, investment, and prior cultural knowledge, which can be translated into advantages in other social fields. Moreover, empirical research is now sufficient enough to show that omnivores are selective and they show little tolerance for the genres associated with lower social/cultural status. Therefore, this repertoire may very well be considered a new form of distinction—a strategy the economically and culturally advantaged use to “make” their identity and distinguish themselves from others. The debate has progressed quite successfully. Many different types of omnivorousness have been discovered since the term was first coined; not every eclectic repertoire holder follows the same trajectory of boundary crossing. For instance, some omnivorous consumers cross the highbrow-lowbrow boundary by adding highbrow genres to their profile after having experienced upward mobility, while others include lowbrow genres to their once exclusive highbrow taste repertoires. Different forms of omnivorousness—and their degree of cultural tolerance—allow us to see more clearly the current status of the association between cultural hierarchy and consumption. Although limited in quantity, some important research has been done critically questioning the kind of social structures, institutions, national contexts, and school curricula that enlarge the cultural cultivated fractions’ repertoires. Recent research on contemporary forms of cultural capital and cosmopolitanism also engages closely with the omnivore debate. It is important to note that arguments still remain with regard to methods and analysis; not every contributor agrees on a common definition for measurement—operationalization—of the omnivore profiles. Some researchers take participation, while others take taste or knowledge, as proxies to measure omnivorousness. Some contributors measure only the breadth (the status of the genres preferred) and others measure volume of tastes (the number of preferred genres/activities) without looking at their composition, namely how far people cross boundaries. Other disagreements (methodological and theoretical) with regard to other aspects of the debate have been briefly referred to above. These disagreements not only make the debate more lively and dynamic, but also ensure that interest in the concept does not decrease over time.</p>",sociology

Originating in the work of Max Weber, this division, by asserting the independent influence of status groups and interests, represented a key departure from Karl Marx’s insistence on the primacy of economic or class relationships. Despite the long-established prominence of this concept in the field of sociology, status has been variously defined and employed. Some definitions, following Veblen, focus on the individual aspects of status, referring to the rank, prestige, or esteem of one’s position in a social hierarchy. Other definitions focus on status groups or communities defined by shared lifestyles; these groups use these common status identities to gain access to valuable resources, privileges, and entitlements and defend those they already possess. Contemporary empirical research on status has focused primarily on socioeconomic status or experimental studies of small groups, although there is a burgeoning literature on the role that status plays in structuring markets and determining organizational outcomes.</p>",sociology

He first became interested in world affairs, particularly the anticolonial movement in India, as a teenager living in New York City. After serving in the US Army from 1951 to 1953, he wrote his MA thesis in the burgeoning subfield of political sociology, arguing that McCarthyism was only marginally against communism and, instead, was a program of the “practical right” against the “sophisticated conservatives.” His PhD thesis, however, was on the role of voluntary associations in nationalist movements in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. He won a Ford Foundation Fellowship to conduct his dissertation research in West Africa, working across linguistic barriers. In 1960, Wallerstein first met Frantz Fanon, who became an important and lasting influence on his work. In 1973, Wallerstein became president of the African Studies Association. As a result of his intellectual roots in Africana studies, national liberation, core-periphery relations, and critiques of Eurocentrism continue to be central concerns of his work. Wallerstein earned his BA (1951), MA (1954), and PhD (1959) from Columbia University, where he then joined the faculty. In 1968, he participated in and supported student protests against the university’s complicity in the Vietnam War. From 1971 to 1976, he taught at McGill University before joining the faculty at the State University of New York at Binghamton (SUNY Binghamton). At SUNY Binghamton, he founded the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations, one of the premier institutes supporting research in world-systems analysis. At the Fernand Braudel Center, he became founding editor of the journal Review, the first journal dedicated to world-systems research. In 1994–1995, he chaired the Gulbenkian Commission, which endeavored to break down the disciplinary boundaries among the historical social sciences. He remained at SUNY Binghamton until his retirement in 1999 and since 2000 was Senior Research Scholar at Yale University.

In the context of the United States in particular, the presence of ethnic, cultural, and religious heterogeneity is more commonly referred to as diversity, while in most other contexts the mere presence of such heterogeneity is dubbed multiculturalism—the most general formulation of multiculturalism in sociology. However, multiculturalism is also an ideological position founded upon the claim that minority identities are important to the people who hold them, and that the identity groups they create will persist. Because identity and identity groups matter, they must be recognized and accommodated in social and political life. Generally speaking, the sociology of multiculturalism falls into six broad categories: the study of growing population diversity, commonly referred to as demographic multiculturalism; multicultural theory; multicultural policy; the impact of multiculturalism; the retreat from multiculturalism; and examination of multiculturalism as a cultural object. Due to its broad subject matter—recent and contemporary cultural diversity and the changes it has wrought in societies and nations—the study of multiculturalism is particularly interdisciplinary. The sociology of multiculturalism overlaps many other areas of research in sociology: migration and immigrant inclusion, national identity and citizenship, religious studies, and racial and ethnic studies, just to name a few. Multiculturalism is also a common subject in the fields of education, political science, philosophy, cultural studies, and history. This article focuses almost exclusively on work that is done in sociology and by sociologists. In addition, the sociology of multiculturalism is, most especially, an international field of research.</p>",sociology
10.1332/policypress/9781447346166.003.0001,"<p>This introductory chapter provides an overview of sexism in sociology. In much sociology, women as a social group are invisible or inadequately represented: they take the insubstantial form of ghosts, shadows, or stereotyped characters. This issue of sexism has a direct relevance to the main topic of this book: a survey of housewives and their attitudes to housework which was carried out in London in 1971. The conventional sociological approach to housework could be termed ‘sexist’: it has treated housework merely as an aspect of the feminine role in the family — as a part of women's role in marriage, or as a dimension of child-rearing — not as a work role. This book thus departs from sociological tradition and takes a new approach to women's domestic situation by looking at housework as a job and seeing it as work, analogous to any other kind of work in modern society.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0125,"<p>Ethnicity, and its sibling concept race, lies close to the center of sociological concern. Together these intertwining ideas constitute one of the driving forces in human affairs. Alongside class and gender, ethnicity and race amount to one of the primary axes of sociological analysis. Ethnicity and race have been especially prominent in sociological, political, anthropological, and historical analyses of the United States, but they also exist in every part of the world in local forms. Ethnicity and race are not quite the same thing, but they are intimately related, so their relationship, and the history of ideas about them, bears contemplating. The common view of both scientists and the general public for most of the last two centuries was that humankind is naturally divided up into four or five big races: white, black, yellow, red (and sometimes brown). Each was identified with origins in a different part of the globe: Europe, Africa, East Asia, the Americas (and sometimes the Malay Peninsula and island Southeast Asia). It was posited that each of these races constituted a separate type of people that could easily be distinguished from the others both by physical features and at the genetic level. Until the last few generations, scholars and the public presumed that each race also had a particular personality type, intelligence level, potential for achievement, and natural place in the social order. In the view common at that time, ethnic groups were seen as subgroups of races, marked off more by culture than by genetics. The European or white race included Swedes, Italians, Poles, Scots, and so on. The Asian or yellow race comprised Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, Pakistanis, and so on. The black or African race was made up of Ibo, Yoruba, San, Fulani, Bambara, Mandinka, and a host of other ethnic peoples. The common view was that race was about biology, but ethnicity was about culture and consent. One could not change one’s race, but one’s ethnicity was partly subject to choice. Certainly, in that view, ethnicity was a matter more of behavior than of biology. To be sure, mostly Muslim Pakistanis had different religious ways, foodways, languages, and child-rearing practices than did mostly Buddhist Koreans. Yet it was hard to deny that people from Korea also didn’t look very much like people from Pakistan. And it could not be denied that one could talk meaningfully about black culture in the United States or Britain. So as more and more people came into contact with people from different parts of the world, it became harder and harder to sustain the notion that races were big, permanent, and easily definable, and that racial boundaries were decided on a physical or biological basis, while ethnic groups were smaller subsidiary groups whose differences were cultural and mutable. Over the course of the 20th century, the notion of biologically separated races and culturally separated ethnic groups gradually gave way to a view of humankind as a single field of infinite variety, with one population shading, physically and culturally, into the next almost imperceptibly as one moved across the globe. Scholars and some of the public became aware that, whether one considered genotype or phenotype, the differences between the so-called races were really very small—much smaller than the biological similarities between them. And the physical differences between ethnic groups could be quite large—the average Pakistani does not look much like the average Korean; the average Norwegian does not look much like the average Italian. In the past few decades scholars have almost entirely eschewed the notion of races as longstanding, biologically discrete categories. Instead, they have emphasized that racial ideas were constructed by historical actors, in particular times and places we can identify, for reasons at which we can make at least educated guesses. Constructedness and contingency are at the core of our understanding of ethnicity and race in the 21st century. We have come to see race and ethnicity as processes more than categories. Many sociologists speak of racialization: a process by which one set of people writes a story of essential, indelible difference (and frequently inferiority) onto another set of people. Some people think of the differences between groups as ethnic—that is, as primarily cultural—until the racial moment, when someone imputes to those differences a primordial, indelible quality, and racialization occurs. Yet the residue of the earlier, biologistic view of race as something physical and indelible, but ethnicity as something cultural and malleable, still lurks beneath the surface, shaping the perceptions and actions of the general public and of more than a few social scientists. Though race is now seen as a socially constructed category, not a biological essence, race and ethnicity nonetheless operate powerfully to shape the life chances of individuals. Some people’s life chances are significantly greater than other people’s on account of the races, religions, or ethnic groups to which they are assigned. People kill people because of their race or their ethnicity—whether in Nazi Germany or the American South or the Balkans of the 1990s. The fact that race and ethnicity are social constructions rather than biologically based facts does not mean that they do not have powerful real-life consequences. This bibliography does not include studies of specific ethnic and racial groups, except in a few cases where particular group studies were classic markers in the development of the field of ethnic and racial studies.

These variations are diverse and innate. Intersex human rights defenders and human rights institutions challenge the stigma and discrimination that intersex people face because of their physical variations, but few jurisdictions so far have tackled the human rights violations that intersex people suffer. There are multiple additional, contested, and incommensurate lenses through which intersex people are viewed. These express different values and beliefs about the same people, including their meaning, treatment, concerns, and demands. Medical lenses view intersex traits as “disorders of sex development” (DSD), and people with those traits are viewed as female or male and subjects for treatment. Anthropology and queer and gender studies have viewed intersex as an illustration of fallacies that underpin subjective cultural norms for sex and gender. Law increasingly views intersex people as members of a third sex. Historical research shows that intersex people, often termed hermaphrodites, have always existed, and often been accommodated.</p>",sociology

Finally, it considers the influence of French psychological sociology on contemporary cognitive sociology, surveying some of the theoretical and methodological innovations that have resulted as well as possible avenues for further development of these interdisciplinary fields.",sociology
10.1177/s003803859900019x,"The purpose of this paper is to describe an integrated (meta) theoretical framework that I call anti-reductionist sociology: this entails a focus on agency, structure (the `conditions-of-action'), and social chance; micro-macro; and time-space. What follows allows only for a sketch of the framework; I have published fuller theoretical, methodological and policy-related accounts elsewhere. Anti-reductionist sociology is a sensitising theoretical perspective, not a body of substantive theory. This differentiation has an affinity with Mouzelis's (1993:684) distinction between methodological generalisations and substantive generalisations, the present paper being concerned with the former. In Cohen's terminology (1987:279-80) the approach outlined in the paper is ontologically flexible and in some sense electic: while explicitly excluding reductionist, essentialist, reified and teleological formulations, anti-reductionist sociology is a synthetic metatheoretical framework designed to encourage the development of substantive theories that are not necessarily tied to any particular paradigm.",sociology

Caste groups are unequal, ranked on a scale of hierarchy on the basis of their ritual status, from pure to impure. The hierarchy is sanctioned by the Hindu religious belief.

Their outcomes, as such, are usually associated with the transition to modernity, the rise of capitalism, and the emergence of democracy. It is their transformative effect, despite similarities, that sets them apart from rebellions, revolts, political revolutions, and other types of social movements, making them rare events in history. Compared to political revolutions, which are typically orchestrated from above, social revolutions are mass based. Their root causes are structural in nature, and the processes associated with their mass mobilization typically involve cultural, psychological, and political factors. The systematic social scientific study of revolutions may be traced back to the 19th century. These early works accounted for the structural causes and social forces behind them. Some project a concern with the deleterious effects of revolutionary dynamics. In the context of 20th-century history, the events that followed the Russian Revolution spurred academic interest on this complex sociopolitical phenomenon. The first generation of scholarship on revolution may be identified as the “Natural History School.” Scholars writing in this vein in the 1930s identified common historical patterns through which the American, English, French, and Russian Revolutions unfolded. In this perspective, revolutions emerge as a “natural” historical outcome of old regime practices, and their outbreaks follow a sequence of historical events that culminate in the establishment of a new regime. Second-generation theorists writing in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s focused on psychological factors, in particular expectation and frustration mechanisms. Scholars belonging to this generation also paid attention to the effects of institutional imbalance (or systemic pathology) on the potential for revolution. Third-generation scholars, primarily writing in the 1970s and 1980s, developed structural explanations of revolution, claiming that the key to making sense of the causes of revolution requires the student of revolution to consider the nature of “state breakdown” and the revolutionary potential of lower classes. Scholars belonging to this generation also paid attention to the political processes in the development of revolution. Fourth-generation scholars aimed to highlight agency in their analyses, although not at the expense of structural explanations. These scholars, writing since the 1990s, have more concretely examined the role played by culture and ideology, the structural features of gender and race, and increasingly the emotional and storytelling dimensions of revolutionary processes. Since this last generation of scholars’ focus on cultural and structural factors, more recent work has increasingly paid attention to the connections between globalization and revolution.</p>",sociology

Sexuality studies are interdisciplinary and include work from anthropology, gender and women’s studies, history, LGBT studies, psychology, queer studies, and sociology. The social study of sexuality contrasts with biological approaches to human sexuality, which frame sexual expression as resulting from anatomy and hormones. Contemporary social approaches to studying sexualities—the focus of this article—took shape during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when sociologists, feminists, and gay liberationists argued that sexuality (desire, orientation) was not innate, but socially constructed. Thus, contemporary research and theory operates under the assumption that sexual desires, identities, and behaviors are socially constructed. Sexuality studies seek to explain how social institutions and social interaction patterns shape sexual meanings and practices. A significant portion of sexualities work focuses on inequalities between genders, between heterosexuals and nonheterosexuals (of which there are an expanding array of identities, particularly as gender identities expand), races and ethnicities, and social classes.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0111,"<p>Individuals are shaped by the multiple categories to which they are perceived to belong and the social structures that undergird systems of categorization. Systems of social categorization are virtually always associated with differential, unequal resources. Intersectionality is a concept fundamental to understanding these societal inequalities; the key assertion of intersectionality is that the various systems of societal oppression do not act independently of each other. Different systems of inequality are transformed in their intersections, the fundamental principle of intersectionality. The phrase “race, class, and gender,” still in use, is a precursor of the concept of intersectionality. The preferred use of the latter term reflects in part the awareness that there are more than three intersecting systems of societal inequalities. The metaphors noted in the section Metaphors of Intersectionality below have been powerful visualizations of this complexity. Further, some identities may be privileged categories, others marginalized. Thus oppression and privilege may be experienced simultaneously, complicating the analysis of inequality. These issues are addressed in the section Critiques of Intersectionality below. Intersectionality crosses levels of analysis, from the micro-level experiences of individual actors to the macro-level structural, organizational, and institutional contexts in which human interactions and experiences are formed. Intersectionality is an analytic approach, a way of thinking about social categories that articulates similarity and difference, always inflected by relations of power. Research adopting an intersectional lens falls into several not entirely distinct groups: theoretical and methodological debates, evident in the sections Organizational Frameworks of Intersectionality and Methodologies, and applications of intersectional dynamics and political interventions, evident in the sections Intersectional Praxis and Transnational Intersectionalities. Intersectionality is also a deeply interdisciplinary concept, an analytic approach that can be found in almost all of the social sciences as well as the humanities; examples here are drawn from political science and psychology, in addition to the sociological examples appropriate to this series.</p>",sociology

Current presumptions about the distinction between human behaviour and artificial intelligence are identified through a survey of discussions about AI and `expert systems'. These discussions exhibit a restricted view of sociological competence, a marked rhetoric of progress and a wide variation in assessments of the state of the art. By drawing upon recent themes in the social study of science, these discussions are shown to depend on certain key dichotomies and on an interpretive flexibility associated with the notions of intelligence and expertise. The range of possible associations between sociology and AI reflects the extent to which we are willing to adopt these features of AI discourse. It is suggested that one of the more important options is to view the AI phenomenon as an occasion for reassessing the central axiom of sociology that there is something distinctively `social' about human behaviour.",sociology

The article proposes a synthetic analysis of this change, starting with statistical data on the migration of populations from the poorest countries on Earth to the richest ones. The analysis focuses on what is happening in the vast area of the Mediterranean. The history of the Mediterranean, this is the hypothesis put forward in the article, could help us to reflect innovatively on the demographic and cultural dynamics that are taking place in a particularly significant way. The reason for which it is hypothesized that the Mediterranean could be the privileged social place where we can reflect on the metamorphosis we are experiencing lies in the long tradition of welcoming diversity and in the capacity for the coexistence of religions, cultures, and civilizations that, over the centuries, have been the force thanks to which the whole world has been dominated, despite the clashes that historiography has unquestionably shown us. The article shows the important commitment of the leaders of the different world religions in generating spaces for encounters and dialogue between cultural diversities that cannot be analyzed within the paradigm of confrontation but require to be understood within the paradigm of confrontation and responsible coexistence. The work done so far clearly shows the possibility of dialogue between diversities, as well as pointing the way forward to socialize all different cultures to be together, without clashing for dominance; in this task, the reflections of Pope Francis and Edgar Morin on the concepts of brotherhood and fraternity appear particularly useful.",sociology

A closely related concept, “childhood,” refers to the life stage of these individuals. During the middle of the 20th century, sociologists generally were not focused on studying children, leaving that field to psychologists, who often studied children from the perspective of developmental psychology. Subsequently, three major streams of sociological thought began to develop. The first looked at how child development was conditioned by both historical and social circumstances. The second studied how children created their own worlds and were themselves active agents, rather than passive recipients of socialization. The third highlighted the importance of societal and family investment in children. For many researchers, scholarship from psychology, economics, and demography was combined with insights from sociology to provide new information on child well-being. As a consequence, several categories for entries in this article overlap conceptually. This means that entries logically could be listed under other subheadings or duplicated across these categories.

What distinguishes a sociological approach to discrimination as an explanatory object from that in other disciplines, namely psychology or economics, is its insistence on looking at the macro level of analysis, explaining the phenomenon as a result of social processes not necessarily reducible to individual-level preferences or cognitive processes.

But for shaping the global agenda of sociology, this essay argues, the sociological discourse in India first had to deconstruct its alter ego. Overcoming the reception of western sociology as a monolithic construct will remove an intellectual obstacle. This leitmotiv is discussed by reflecting on three recent books, by Yogesh Atal, T. K. Oommen and Yogendra Singh, which analyse the development of Indian sociology as a ‘locus of struggles’ (Bourdieu): Where did it come from? How does it operate? Where will it go? While tracing its evolution and interaction with western sociological discourse, the essay first discusses the introduction of social sciences to India as a colonial heritage that implanted empiricist ‘outsider ’ studies of ‘native’ cultures, and identifies the reception of the American siblings of structural-functionalism and empiricism that dominated western sociology in the 1960s. Both intellectual encounters provoked the traditionalist call for indigenization as a counterforce to the perceived westernization of Indian social thought from 1950 to 1980.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0162,"<p>Racism is a doctrine that holds that the world’s human population consists of various “races” that are the primary determinants of human traits and capacities. This doctrine typically regards one’s own race as superior to other races. Intergroup hatred and discrimination generally accompanies racist doctrines. Social science investigates racism at three interrelated levels. First, individual racism involves those individuals who hold racist beliefs. Here racist ideas often overlap with such concepts as prejudice, xenophobia, bigotry, and intolerance. But the key distinguishing feature of individual racism is that the group differences are viewed as innate and unchangeable. If assimilation or conversion is viewed as possible, then intolerance is involved but not racism. Second, situational racism occurs when racist behavior is shaped by the social context. This occurs when face-to-face situations are patterned, based on racist beliefs, to place one group in an inferior position in intergroup interaction. This occurs, for example, when one racial group in a situation possesses most of the resources that emphasize the status differences between the groups. Finally, third, structural and cultural racism results when a society’s institutions are shaped by racist beliefs and results in group discrimination. Indeed, racism’s effects can invade virtually all of a society’s institutions. Thus, racism differentiates human beings from one another by presumed “races,” and this leads to unequal access to resources and opportunities as well as to other forms of inequality such as gender-, ethnic-, and class-based inequity.

The list includes psychologists (e.g., social, developmental, clinical, cognitive, counseling), sociologists, anthropologists, and health scientists. Different disciplines employ various approaches to address relationships. For instance, social psychologists seek universal properties in human relations. Sociologists, on the other hand, pay much attention to changes in family ties and social connections and how social structures and contexts (e.g., social class, race, gender, norms, and social policy) impact these relationships. Relationships have been a central research concern in sociology. Sociologists have been particularly interested in studies of intimate relationships, such as marriage and other familial ties. In sociology, social relationships are divided into primary and secondary groups. Primary ties are characterized by direct, personal, and intimate interactions. In addition, primary group members exchange tacit items such as support, love, and concern. Examples of these would be family ties and close friends. Secondary social groups, on the other hand, such as political parties and trade unions, are usually impersonal and instrumental and are formed to fulfill special interests. The recent major sociological themes in research on relationships include the structural changes of relations, inequality and dynamics in relationships, variations over the life course, diversity of relationships, and the connections between individual ties and social context.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0271,"<p>Economic globalization is a term generally used to encompass the wide variety of interrelationships, networks, and processes that integrate economies across and above nation-states. While there is much consternation in the popular press about globalization generally and economic globalization specifically that suggests that something new and never before seen is taking place, social scientists across a handful of decades offer a more tempered view, depicting a functionally integrated global economy as an historical thing that nonetheless transforms and develops over time. The rich literature that has developed on this topic draws the readers’ attention to particular historical times and processes that constitute the early formations of the global economy we know today, even as its size and scope has intensified in recent decades. In this vein, scholars have devoted much attention to specifying the key indicators of economic globalization including—to name just a few— trade, global commodity chains, foreign direct investment, and financialization. All of these processes are the means by which economies are globally interwoven through the production, distribution, and circulation of goods, information, money, culture, and people. A similar amount of scholarly attention has examined the outcomes of economic globalization, and how they vary for different actors. Here inequalities of resources and power are central focal points, including those within and among nations, between capital and labor, and within the world-system hierarchy. The impact of economic globalization on marginalized people and places, as demarcated by gender, race, migration status, and environmental locations, as well as on nation-states and their capacity to govern effectively, are also topics of much interest. Finally, scholars have examined the many important issues related to the governance and regulation of economic globalization, which as a set of processes is occurring at a higher level than the nation-state and includes an ever-shifting balance of power between a number of actors and institutional bodies. International organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, are examples of quasi-governmental organizational bodies, though of varied effectiveness, as are international financial institutions. Finally corporate regulation in the global economy remains scarce, although recently corporate social responsibility initiatives have begun to be investigated and evaluated as a type of self-regulation. Although economic globalization is nothing if not hotly contested subject matter, scholarly research provides an exciting conversation, mapped here through its origins, its contemporary state and constituent elements, its differential outcomes for various actors, and the problems and possibilities of its governance.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0053,"<p>Broadly defined, social stratification is an important part of many areas of study in sociology, but it also constitutes a distinct field on its own. Simply put, social stratification is the allocation of individuals and groups according to various social hierarchies of differing power, status, or prestige. Although divisions are often based on gender, religion, or race and ethnicity, the present entry focuses largely on socioeconomic inequalities, for the most part leaving other forms of social inequality to other entries. In this regard, social stratification is found in every society, even if it takes on slightly different forms. Uncovering what accounts for differences in social stratification—among societies and within particular societies over time—is a long-standing goal of the field. The classic works of early stratification sociologists—spurred by the work of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim—tended to be concerned with the question of “why” and “how” stratification arose in the first place. Although this debate continues to be an underlying motivation for much research on stratification, empirical research typically tackles questions for which evidence is more tangible. By the 1950s, stratification research was increasingly concerned with social mobility, though mostly within individual countries. By the 1980s, explaining cross-national differences in stratification became an important goal of the field. By now, stratification research is characterized by several debates. Although it has received somewhat less attention in the past decade or so, a classic debate centers on how socioeconomic position should be measured. Emphasis here has been on the applicability of measures of social class, status, and prestige. Although there are certainly important exceptions, differences in approach generally fall along territorial lines. European sociologists have tended to focus on relevance of occupation-based measures of social class, while North American sociologists have tended to rely on measures of socioeconomic status, which incorporate education as well as occupation. There have also been debates regarding the most effective ways to measure class and socioeconomic status. Yet other debates center on the importance of incorporating race and gender in studies of stratification. Finally, in recent decades emphasis has moved to the importance of education, both as a source of stratification on its own, and how it affects economic inequalities.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0083,"<p>Pierre Bourdieu was born on 1 August 1930 in a rural area of southwestern France. The only child of a peasant sharecropper turned postman, he left his region on the recommendation of a high school teacher to pursue an elite academic curriculum in Paris. He graduated from the prestigious École Normale Supérieure, then at the apex of French academic life. There he studied philosophy. He concentrated on epistemology and on the history of science, which set him against the then dominant current, existentialism, personified by Jean-Paul Sartre. Bourdieu’s vocation in philosophy shifted abruptly to the social sciences after he was drafted into the French army and sent to Algeria at the height of its Liberation War (1956–1962). There he turned to empirical inquiry, carrying out both ethnographic and statistical studies of colonial transformation, as well as absorbing the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss. Upon his return to France, Bourdieu completed his conversion to sociology: he became Director of Studies at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris (1964); he founded a research center (1968), launched a journal (Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales, 1975), and assembled a research team focusing on symbolic power, and social inequality in their broadest manifestations. After the 1970s, Bourdieu tackled an increasingly diverse set of empirical topics (spanning art, ritual, kinship, religion, science, intellectuals, language, social classes, and political institutions, inter alia) while developing his own paradigm, seeking a pathway out of the opposition between structuralist objectivism and constructivist subjectivism—first proposed in Outline of a Theory of Practice. He then honed his distinctive conceptual triad of habitus, capital, and field in Distinction (1984) before he was elected to the Collège de France in 1982, where his research expanded to encompass the state, gender domination, the social foundations of the economy, and the experience of social suffering in contemporary society. Bourdieu addressed salient social issues, as in The Weight of the World (1999), and deepened his rethinking of the distinctive logic of practice and the epistemological dilemmas of social inquiry in Pascalian Meditations (2000). He became a leading public figure in the global mobilization against neoliberalism, while his work gained international influence across the social sciences and the humanities. At the time of his sudden death in 2002, he was working on a “general theory of fields.”</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0110,"<p>Defining the meaning of motherhood is more complex than once thought. Due to technological and legal changes there is more and more variation among mothers with respect to age, marital status, and sexual orientation. Adoption has long shown that social motherhood is not contingent on giving birth, and surrogacy and in vitro fertilization now create a possible distinction between the gestational mother and the genetic mother. As a result, the very definition of who is a mother can be contentious. The very process of conception, pregnancy, and birthing has undergone much transition, with much greater involvement of medical professionals. The meanings associated with motherhood and motherhood practices vary across historical, sociocultural, and political contexts. Despite the great variation, even within specific countries at one point in time in the practices of motherhood, discourses about what exactly constitutes “good” mothering and who should and should not mother exist. Those at the “frontier” of motherhood, such as queer mothers, continue to shape and reshape the very concept of motherhood and mothering. For many mothers this means they are caught between cultural expectations on how to mother and the realities of their everyday life: for example, breastfeeding practices and childcare arrangements. Although rates of mothers’ labor-force participation are high or increasing in many countries, mothers still face the primary burden of arranging, managing, and even financing childcare solutions for their children; work-family conflict remains a problem for mothers much more so than for fathers. Polices designed to ease the conflict between employment and motherhood, both those implemented by governments and those created by employers, vary greatly across countries, which reemphasizes the context dependency of the meaning of motherhood for women’s lives. Many aspects of research on motherhood suggest that motherhood, and especially the link between motherhood and employment continues to be an important component of persistent gender inequality. In addition to contributing to inequalities between men and women, and between women within any given society, motherhood also contributes to global inequality (through the transnational market for care workers), international adoptions, and international surrogacy.</p>",sociology

It includes media objects, entertainment and leisure, fashion and trends, and linguistic conventions, among other things. Popular culture is usually associated with either mass culture or folk culture, and differentiated from high culture and various institutional cultures (political culture, educational culture, legal culture, etc.). The association of popular culture with mass culture leads to a focus on the position of popular culture within a capitalist mode of economic production. Through this economic lens, popular culture is seen as a set of commodities produced through capitalistic processes driven by a profit motive and sold to consumers. In contrast, the association of popular culture with folk culture leads to a focus on subcultures such as youth cultures or ethnic cultures. Through this subculture lens, popular culture is seen as a set of practices by artists or other kinds of culture makers that result in performances and objects that are received and interpreted by audiences, both within and beyond the subcultural group. Holistic approaches examine the ways that popular culture begins as the collective creation of a subculture and is then appropriated by the market system. Key issues in the sociological analysis of popular culture include the representation of specific groups and themes in the content of cultural objects or practices, the role of cultural production as a form of social reproduction, and the extent to which audiences exercise agency in determining the meanings of the culture that they consume.</p>",sociology

How do, and how should, the social sciences, and particularly sociology, react to these pathologies of late modernity?

10.1177/1468795x241296085,"Gregor McLennan sees my book as inaugurating a new phase of “multiplex” postcolonial sociology. This approach moves away from sweeping generalizations about Eurocentrism, Manicheaism, complicity, and pervasive coloniality in “Western” sociology. It pays closer attention to sociology’s internal heterogeneity and is less distrustful of scientific norms such as validity, objectivity, evidence, autonomy, scientific neutrality, and explanation. More specifically, my approach relies (1) on the idea of “context” from the classic sociology of knowledge and intellectual history; (2) on the concept of “field” from Bourdieu; (3) on methods of “close reading” and textual interpretation from literary criticism; and (4) on the “historians’ craft” (Bloch) of using the most extensive available archive of published and unpublished sources. I argue that we can evaluate historical thinkers in their contexts, assessing the constraints and spaces of possibility they faced, and then examine their intellectual choices, the moves they make in the social scientific game. This approach aligns more closely with the ideas of the founders of postcolonial theory, who were more interested in texts that “brush up unstintingly against historical constraints” rather than those that are “inertly of their time” (Edward Said). McLennan agrees that postcolonial sociology is indebted to European Enlightenment traditions; I focus on its roots in the sociology of knowledge and sociological historicism. The article then responds to McLennan’s main “probes.” The first concerns the methodological problem of “labeling investigations as ʽsociologyʼ and specific people as ʽsociologistsʼ”, and the limits of field theory. The second concerns my “outline of a theory of colonial sociological practice,” which tries to understand the dilemmas facing sociologists in colonial situations and the historians who study them. The third probe addresses the question of the scientific exploitation of empire. The sociologists I emphasize did not approach the colonized as a pool of resources to be extracted and exploited but worked across the colonial boundary line to generate knowledge. Although the book focuses on the mid-20th century, I return in my comments to Durkheim, upon whose shoulders so much of the later work was standing. The key is that Durkheim was also a theorist of empire and colonialism and politically an anticolonialist. He described colonies as anomic spaces and rejected biological concepts and hierarchical notions of civilization. He rejected universalistic values while advocating a system of states governed by historically specific morality and law rather than violence. Finally, Durkheim reversed the “imperial gaze,” directing it back at Europe.",sociology

This is now gradually coming into existence through an accumulation of recent or current studies, some directed towards theoretical research, others guided by more immediate practical considerations (such as the problems of town-planning).  In actual fact, urban sociology seems unlikely to develop, in France, into a specialized branch of sociology.

Household labor perpetuates the social structures associated with family, gender, inequality and the labor force. Provisioning families and keeping up the household all fall under the general rubric of non-market labor, that is, the unpaid work that includes not only housework, but also caring for family members. Because this takes place outside public view and falls largely to women, the value of housework to families and society has often been overlooked or discounted. Until the middle of the 20th century, household labor received little scholarly attention outside the applied field of home economics. As female employment rates increased, however, men’s and women’s lives converged in the realm of paid work, raising questions about why change came more slowly to private households. Although men do more work around the house than their fathers did a generation ago, women still do the lion’s share, and some chores remain stubbornly stereotyped as “women’s work.” Indeed, the allocation of housework is a telling indicator of gender inequality in individual households and societies. Housework also reflects on class inequality, because high-income women can hire poor women to do the job. Domestic arrangements are the outcome of both micro-level family circumstances and macro-level cultural and structural forces. Gender attitudes, partners’ time constraints, their relative resources in bargaining over the chores, and the presence of children illustrate the micro-level influences on the volume and distribution of housework. Cross-national differences in domestic practices demonstrate that the characteristics of social institutions and social policies shape intimate domestic arrangements. How the housework is managed matters for marital relationships, personal well-being, individual careers and population processes. The demand for household labor has created a transnational labor force of domestic workers with implications for global inequality.</p>",sociology

Methodologically, it privileges deep, immersive fieldwork alongside research participants. Substantively, it focuses on interactions and institutions that define urban space, whether those are public streets, neighborhood organizations, or community events. Urban ethnographies have traditionally thought of “communities” geographically, examining how the central topics of poverty, crime, culture, and peer group formation play out in delimited spaces such as neighborhoods, wards, and districts. Theoretically, it has historically tended to draw on social-constructionist and interactionist orientations, conceiving of the urban life as something “built up,” so to speak, from repeated and ritualized encounters. As one of the longest-standing and iconic subfields of sociology, anthropology, and other humanistic social sciences, urban ethnography remains one of the most influential modes of understanding social life in cities. True to form as one of the most conflictual and controversial subfields, an increasing number of scholars are pushing back on convention, insisting on the need to embrace theoretical orientations that are more critical and structurally focused, and to more adequately consider the global forces and relational dynamics that exist beyond, but fatefully impinge upon, bounded field sites.

As an academic discipline, social policy is distinct in its empirical focus on welfare provision but overlaps with other social science fields such as sociology, political science, and public administration. From a narrow standpoint, social policy refers to policies and practices created to address the needs of individuals, i.e., to provide welfare. From a broader standpoint, social policy can be used to motivate individual behavior; is inherently related to the creation of social inequalities across class, gender, race, and sexualities; and is closely tied to capital. Social policy encompasses a wide range of policies, including activation, care, education, families, health care, pensions/aging, poverty/social assistance, and unemployment. Social policy practice refers to the administration of social policies and service delivery. Welfare provision is not limited to government—markets, employers, nongovernmental organizations, churches, and informal networks all play a role in welfare provision, although this varies across countries. The focus, however, particularly in social policy research, is often on government policies and the provision of services. In particular, social policy is often discussed in relation to the welfare state because social policies represent the public or collective management of social risks, an essential function of welfare states. In recent years, social policy research has become increasingly comparative, with a focus on cross-national analyses of systems, policies, and service provision.

Existing work in this area examines income disparities between countries (often characterized by the familiar North-South gap in development), as well as the distribution of income within countries (as is often summarized by the Kuznets Curve or the Great U-Turn). Some of this work is descriptive, examining how levels of development or inequality vary across countries and/or how these levels change over time. Much of it, however, attempts to identify causal factors that contribute to a country’s economic growth, underdevelopment, or changes in its income distribution. Scholars develop models that either focus on internal conditions (institutions, geography, state policy) or external forces (different forms of economic globalization, including international trade, foreign investment, and aid). There has been considerable debate among scholars as to whether income differences between countries are narrowing (i.e., the convergence literature) or not. Less attention is given to whether income distributions among countries are becoming more similar (convergence in inequality levels). In addition, some scholars combine these two pieces of information (i.e., inequality between and within countries) to study world income inequality, with a similar emphasis on description; causal explanation (examining internal and external factors); and debate over whether or not convergence is occurring. Related work examines how national income inequality influences economic growth, intergenerational mobility, poverty, health, violence, and human rights conditions. Theoretically, excessive inequality is thought to slow growth, hinder mobility, and concentrate a greater number of people below the poverty line. A number of scholars design empirical studies that test these assumptions, however, producing results that often confirm these assumptions, but that also offer qualifications to help nuance these arguments. Finally, scholars are now turning their attention to the distribution of wealth, a more immense type of inequality, but one that remains understudied due to the lack of data coverage across time and space. Although this line of research remains in its infancy, scholars should eventually be able to replicate the vast literature on income inequality with a research agenda focused entirely on the global distribution of wealth (and its components parts that exist within and between countries), as well as related work on intergenerational mobility and household poverty as it pertains to asset accumulation.</p>",sociology

In some countries, more than one in five residents were not born in the country where they live, while the economies of other countries are heavily dependent on the money that migrants send back. Migration thus affects a wide range of societies around the globe and can affect almost all aspects of human life. Sociologists consequently seek to explain population movements and state policies of migration control, debate theories of integration across a range of human activities, and consider the consequences of migration for development, national identities, and conceptions of membership in a world increasingly characterized by human relationships that span the borders of contemporary nation-states. Sociologists who work on migration do so in conversation with scholars drawn from many disciplines, including anthropology, demography, economics, ethnic studies, geography, history, legal studies, and political science.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0084,"<p>“Social closure” is one of the most basic terms and concepts in sociology. Basically, closure refers to processes of drawing boundaries, constructing identities, and building communities in order to monopolize scarce resources for one’s own group, thereby excluding others from using them. Society is not a homogenous entity but is instead internally structured and subdivided by processes of social closure. Some social formations, such as groups, organizations, or institutions, may be open to everybody, provided they are capable of participation, while access to most others is limited due to certain criteria that either allow people to become members or exclude them from membership. Therefore, social closure is a ubiquitous, everyday phenomenon that can be observed in almost every sphere and place in the social world. Members of societies experience closure from the very beginning of their social life. To be excluded from certain groups starts at school, where presumably homogenous classes begin to subdivide into distinct peer groups or sports teams. Here, exclusion may be rather arbitrary, but the experience of having a door slammed in one’s face proceeds in cases, where inclusion depends on formal rules or preconditions. Access to private schools follows explicit rules and depends on financial capacities; access to university depends on a certificate or diploma, eventually from certain schools only; membership in a highly prestigious club depends on economic and social capital and the respective social networks; and finally, in the case of migration, people will have to be eligible for citizenship and pass the thorny path of naturalization. However, it is not just the enormous plurality of forms that makes social closure crucial for sociology. Rather, the process of closure of social relations—of groups, organizations, institutions, and even national societies—is the fundamental process of both “communal” (Vergemeinschaftung) and “associative” relationships (Vergesellschaftung), and neither would be possible without social closure.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0229,"<p>Theoretically, the term “doing gender” first appeared in Harold Garfinkel’s case study of the intersexual Agnes in 1967, as an appendix to Garfinkel 1967 (cited under General Overview). The term was then discussed in Kessler and McKenna 1978 (cited under General Overview). The authors drew from Erving Goffman’s social constructionist theory of performance in establishing, first, the difference between sex and gender, and second, how gender was something people actively constructed in their daily lives. The provocation was therefore that if people were responsible for “doing” gender then they could also be held accountable for “undoing” gender. The book, however, was obscured by the proliferation of research regarding sex roles, rather than gender constructions. So, the concept of “doing gender” remained underground for a while, until it resurfaced in 1987 in the well-known paper of the same name written by American sociologists Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman (West and Zimmerman 1987, cited under General Overview). According to these authors, “doing” gender is defined as involving the everyday performance of “a complex of socially guided perceptual, interactional, and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of masculine and feminine ‘natures.’ When we view gender as an accomplishment, an achieved property of situated conduct, our attention shifts from matters internal to the individual and focuses on interactional and, ultimately, institutional arenas” (p. 126). West and Zimmerman were primarily focused on understanding how people created gender differences, rather than merely “gender.” Unlike Kessler and McKenna, who discussed the applicability of doing gender in transsexualism, West and Zimmerman finely combed the differences between “sex,” “sex category,” and “gender.” Following on from this, Deutsch 2007 together with Connell 2010 (both cited under Critiques of Doing Gender) critiqued this concept and proposed the “redoing of gender.” For example, Connell’s research uncovered that for transpeople, doing gender entailed “experiences that fit better under either the rubric of undoing gender or of redoing gender,” that transpeople “often attempted to meld together masculine and feminine gender performances” (p. 39), and that “many resisted these pressures by adapting a hybrid gender style of interacting with others. These acts constitute moments of ‘chipping away’ at the established gender order” (pp. 42–43). In addition, Judith Butler (see Butler 2004, cited under Critiques of Doing Gender) was more interested in exploring how gender could be undone, and defines this undoing as escaping “gender as a kind of a doing, an incessant activity performed . . . an improvisation within a scene of constraint” (p. 3) by underlining the “paradox of autonomy, a paradox that is heightened when gender regulations work to paralyze gendered agency at various levels” (p. 101). From this perspective, there are limits to how much agency individuals can have in performing gender. As such and inadvertently, social actors also undo gender when they relate to each other: “Despite one’s best efforts, one is undone, in the face of the other, by the touch, by the scent, by the feel, by the prospect of the touch, by the memory of the feel. And so, when we speak about my sexuality or my gender, as we do (and as we must) we mean something complicated by it” (p. 19). Butler’s focus on embodiment definitively pushed the debate further by critically assessing the usefulness of considering gender as an activity and asking sociologists to consider the ontological implication of the performativity of gender in relation to its mere performance. Her work is important because it clearly underlined the neglect of feminist studies to focus more on transgender identities, thereby sparking the growth of a specific area of knowledge known today as “queer theory.” In response to these developments, “doing gender” was further developed by West and Zimmerman 2009 (cited under General Overview), a celebratory symposium published twenty-two years after West and Zimmerman 1987 to assess the more recent applicability of this term in the field of gender studies. Methodologically, searching for resources on the theme of “doing gender” has focused on the performance of gender and on the domains of research to which it has been applied so far, as indicated by the specific headings in this article, while considering as well the “undoing of gender” and its performativity. Not all experts in the field would agree with this organization. However, it is important to specify the many ways in which the influential concept has branched out and deeply affected the field of gender studies. Therefore, the reader will notice a running consideration in the papers selected for this entry, with both the doing and the undoing of gender across a variety of areas: in education and at work, across cultures and intersectionally, in relation to emotions and in personal life (where a distinction was made again between parenting and romantic coupling and partnership), for youth health, and beyond the binary. This way of organizing the material falls in line with the most recent developments in the field. A simple search on the Web of Science database of the words “doing gender” within the publications category and in the topics of “Sociology” and “Women’s studies” between 1987 (when West and Zimmerman first published their paper) and 2019 reveals a total of 866 resources. Therefore, as not all resources could be included, the ones that appear in this entry were selected based on relevance, recency of publication, number of citations, prominence in the field, and methodological innovation (such as doing gender in visual sociology, or anthologies that focus on diverse cultural examples). The scope was meant to be relevant, versatile, approachable, and useful to teachers, researchers, and interested students. Nonetheless, there is the limitation that only English-language resources are included. The General Overview section is focused on the development of the term “doing gender” in theory and research, including the original paper discussed in this section and others published in a symposium, while the section on Critiques of Doing Gender presents a series on ongoing critiques to the concept of “doing gender.”</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0267,"<p>While cities have existed for millennia, it wasn’t until the advent of industrialization in the late eighteenth century that the world entered a process of mass urbanization. Sociology has been preoccupied with understanding the nature of urban life since then. Yet since the turn of the twenty-first century, sociologists, geographers, and urban studies scholars have begun noting that the voluminous literature on cities and urban life produced over a century of research and theorizing is almost exclusively based on the metropolitan experience of big cities in the Global North. Emerging literature on small cities has identified several trends that have rendered them nearly invisible to urban sociology. In their search for generalizable knowledge, sociologists have prioritized big cities as the best indicators of urbanity, creating seemingly universal categories of urban analysis that often hide, instead of illuminate, the urban dynamics of small cities. This focus has also created a false sense that most urban dwellers live in the metropolis. In the United States, the majority of the urban population lives in cities with less than 250,000 inhabitants, making them the modal form of urban life, while big cities like NYC, LA, and Chicago are the exception. That said, while drawing attention to small cities as a distinct category of urban research, sociologists have nonetheless struggled to define what constitutes a “small city.” One difficulty stems from sizeism, or the inability to draw clear boundaries based on population size. While “incorporated areas with less than 100,000 residents” is often used as a shorthand, urban characteristics do not suddenly change once such an arbitrary population number is surpassed. Another difficulty is the relativeness of “small” in global context: a Chinese city of 700,000 could be considered small in that context, but not elsewhere. Despite these definitional challenges, this scholarship maintains that renewed attention to small cities should bring tangible benefits to urban sociology at large. Small cities do not represent a lack of, deviant, or antagonistic forms of urbanity; they constitute an important node within the diverse modes of urbanity. Their urban problems may be recognizable to big cities, but often operate through a different set of variables within the small city context. This encyclopedia entry summarizes this corrective turn to the big city bias, outlines existing research on small(er) cities, and underscores growing calls for giving small cities their due attention.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0166,"<p>Social Darwinism is a complex and controversial topic, a package of ideologies supposedly inspired by biological evolutionism that is of interest to scholars of both the life and the social sciences. In principle it includes any political system inspired by the view that human nature and social activity are driven by our biological nature, especially as defined by the process of evolution. The complexity of the topic derives from the fact that the term social Darwinism has been applied to a number of different (and to some extent incompatible) ideologies. The key feature is supposed to be the influence of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, in which the “struggle for existence” determines the “survival of the fittest,” thereby ensuring that the species adapts to new conditions—although it is widely assumed that the process also guarantees progress toward higher levels of complexity. The classic image is of the proponents of unrestrained free-enterprise capitalism justifying their policy by appealing to the “survival of the fittest.” But the term has also been applied to justifications of militarism and imperialism (national or racial struggle) and to the eugenics movement’s efforts to replace natural selection with a process of artificial selection by restricting the reproduction of the “unfit.” The term has also been applied to more or less any claim that human nature is fixed by hereditary factors, especially those linked to social class or race. The topic is contentious because social Darwinism is almost always used in a pejorative sense—the opponents of these ideologies use it to define positions they reject, and this becomes particularly sensitive when applied to areas such as Nazi racial policies and the Holocaust. Most forms of social Darwinism are associated with right-wing ideologies, despite the fact that scholars can point to many left-wing writers who were also inspired by Darwin. The problem of interpretation is compounded by the fact that historians of both the biological and the social sciences are involved, bringing very different interpretive frameworks to bear. Scholars interested in the social world tend to equate social Darwinism with any ideology based on the struggle for existence, whether or not there is evidence of inspiration from biological Darwinism. Historians of science may be well aware that the term refers to a much wider range of ideologies than those inspired directly by Darwin, but they do expect the analysis to respect the fact that other biological ideas and, indeed, other evolutionary mechanisms were involved.</p>",sociology

Growth interests, it argues, especially dominate in countries like the United States, where land and buildings operate as private markets, rather than held in common by government or some other entity; most studies have been US based but many commentaries and analyses have followed on from research elsewhere. Researchers describe pursuit of growth in payrolls, capital spending, or construction activity. As in the classic Marxian framework, such would enhance “exchange value.” In the political sphere, growth interests form up at nested scales where they pressure for advantageous zoning and public infrastructure investments at relevant administrative levels—in roads, sewer lines, and so forth. They lobby and help finance campaigns. Opposition forms up, in turn, from those whose interest in the city is primarily for home life or shared enhancements—represented by civic groups or, increasingly, environmental organizations. They strive for gains, again from the extended Marxian lexicon, in “use value”—substantive public benefits, as in health care, libraries, schools, safety, and parks. The resulting debates, studies, and applications are subjects of hundreds of articles, reviews, and books.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0233,"<p>As communication technologies develop and as organizations create policies to deal with global expansion and work−life balance, work practices and organizational lives have shifted, giving rise to a model of work where employment is not restricted to one particular place or to standard work hours. This model, workplace flexibility, has been the topic of many fields including sociology, organizational psychology, industry relations, gender studies, management, and health research. This article brings together influential studies from these fields and identifies key themes and topics of interest: the institutional and organizational forces that drive demand for workplace flexibility, types and practices of flexibility, disparities in the provision, access to, and usage of flexibility, the impact of flexibility on work-, family-, and health-related outcomes, and variation in these outcomes by workers’ characteristics and across contexts. Only articles published in English are included, but great efforts have been made to include as many international and cross-national studies as possible. As will be seen, research findings on workplace flexibility are not always consistent. Indeed, despite a growing literature that praises work flexibility for accommodating employees’ needs to balance work, leisure, and family and for reducing gender inequalities, there are also studies criticizing flexibility for fueling heightened job demands and job insecurity and for enlarging gender inequalities. This contradiction can be partially addressed by realizing that researchers do not always define “workplace flexibility” in the same way (see more discussion in Types of Workplace Flexibility). Unless noted otherwise, this article defines workplace flexibility as the ability of workers to make choices regarding when, where, and for how long they engage in work-related tasks. Flexible work arrangements, therefore, are organizational practices that permit employees to adjust their work schedule or location to better manage demands outside of work. Rigorous studies—through group-randomized trials or natural experiments—show that flexibility can promote employer and employee outcomes, but only through a systematic cultural change in how work is defined and how workers are rewarded. Given the still prevalent ideal worker norms that expect workers to be highly dedicated to work and that use “time at work” as the sole metric to assess productivity, a more profound change is needed to remove the stigma around flexibility so as to provide viable solutions to contemporary employees’ needs.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0121,"<p>Conversation analysis (hereafter CA) is a rigorously empirical approach to the investigation of social action—or “talk-in-interaction,” to employ the term which has been adopted as the preferred description of the field—which has emerged in the last five decades as the distinctive research program within the wider ethnomethodological perspective. The core premise of CA is that the topic of social interaction per se has been virtually ignored by mainstream social science disciplines and that through the detailed inspection of transcriptions of recordings of conduct in naturally occurring social settings we are able to appreciate the complex forms of order and organization which constitute this bedrock of spoken interaction—the substrate upon which all the institutions of society inescapably depend. The primary aim of CA is to document this order and the systematic methods or practices which human actors rely upon to carry out their everyday social lives. As with its progenitor, ethnomethodology, it is difficult to apply standard scientific categories—theory, method, research design, etc.—to CA. Rather than pursue the testing of hypotheses derived from a priori theorizing, CA favors a more inductive approach to theory building based on the close inspection of actual sequences of conduct. By the same token, although CA does have methodological principles and procedures it is not something that can be utilized in a decontextualized fashion as, for example, an alternative to traditional thematic techniques for analyzing the content of verbal data such as recorded interviews. Since its emergence in the mid-1960s, there have been a number of developments in its core foci. Although the organization of ordinary or mundane conversational interaction still continues to receive scholarly attention, a significant amount of research activity is now undertaken into the talk which transpires in institutional or work-related settings. In addition, many commentators now identify two strands within CA. The first, which has become consolidated as the principal mode of CA research, is concerned with the structural organization of talk and the actions which particular sequences of turns accomplish. The second strand deals with the way descriptions of the social world are made in talk and the categories and commonsense knowledge which are constitutive parts of this process (see Membership Categorization Analysis). Although prominent in the early CA writings, this strand is now less conspicuous. CA is now firmly established within the social sciences. Although its roots are in sociology, the CA approach now informs a great deal of the research work in cognate fields such as linguistics, communication, anthropology, social psychology, education and child development, human-computer interaction, counseling, and psychotherapy.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0245,"<p>Sexual identity research within sociology has largely examined the social contexts of sexuality as a central part of how we think about ourselves. While much of this research focuses on the experiences of marginalized people (gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and other identities), critical attention has also been paid to the social construction of heterosexual or straight identities. Theoretical perspectives from fields like queer theory and psychology have informed this thinking, and activism and research specifically from queer theory has significantly influenced how researchers understand sexual identities. Intersections with other identities are also critical to understanding sexual identities, and much forward-thinking work on sexual identities examines gender, race, class, and ability simultaneously. This bibliography outlines research on sexual identity, beginning with key sources like Journals, Edited Volumes, and Online and Popular Sources. The Theoretical Foundations section includes classic works, best for those seeking an introduction to the field. The Studying Identity: Research Methods section addresses how sexual identities might be best studied, as well as ongoing methodological challenges. Also included are sections discussing how sexual identities have been defined, including histories of sexual identities, intersections with other identities and changing identity categories, research on sexual identity and the self, research that examines the relationship between sexual identity and behavior, and works discussing how sexual identities are understood in relationships and religion. Sections addressing collective sexual identities and identities in spaces examine how identities are used in social movements and how sexual identities shape and are shaped by communities. Finally, a section focused on the political economy of sexual identities addresses the relationships between sexualities, nations, economies, and policy. While the bulk of this bibliography focuses on sexual identities within the United States, sources examining sexual identities in a variety of national and transnational contexts are included in a number of sections.</p>",sociology

A vast majority of scholarship dealing with gender inequality focuses on women and the ways that they are structurally and systematically subordinated to men and disadvantaged. Scholars of inequality note, however, that there are two sides to inequality: disadvantage and privilege. Masculinities scholars study the various ways that men are—as a group—privileged, as well as focusing on the costs of those privileges and the ways in which not all men are granted equal access to them. “Masculinity” refers to the behaviors, social roles, and relations of men within a given society as well as the meanings attributed to them. The term masculinity stresses gender, unlike male, which stresses biological sex. Thus studies of masculinities need not be confined to biological males. Masculinity studies is a feminist-inspired, interdisciplinary field that emerged in the last few decades of the 20th century as a topic of study. It deals with the diversity of identities, behaviors, and meanings that occupy the label masculine and does not assume that they are universal. Thus scholars of masculinity often refer to masculinities in the plural to highlight the diversity of meanings, roles, and behaviors consumed in the term. Despite the fact that gender is often experienced as intensely personal—an internal facet of our identity—masculinities are produced and reproduced through the course of our daily interactions as well as within the larger institutions of society. This bibliography provides resources and an introductory overview of historical studies of masculinity, theories of masculinity and gender inequality, the relationship between masculinity and sexuality, the literature dealing with diverse men’s movements, and a summary of findings within various social institutions (education, the family, the workplace, sport, and the media).</p>",sociology

Religion was an obsession of the first sociologists, and it has been argued that American sociology was invented in reaction to religion. Since that time religion has remained central to the sociological canon as religion has remained a central component of society. Sociologists up until the last quarter of the 20th century assumed that religion was in the process of a slow death—a process called “secularization.” Sociologists now see secularization as occurring only in certain parts of social life, opening the door to the study of the religious influences on a range of social behaviors such as immigration, race relations, and politics. For example, some scholars have asked why immigrants are more religious than others. Other sociologists continue to study religion itself in congregations, or as systems of belief. For example, some sociologists have asked why American religion is increasingly individualistic. American sociologists of religion have remained focused on religion in America and have made limited forays into other parts of the world.

In particular there was awareness that `race' politics was also an `urban' politics. The problematic of the slumghetto sharpened in focus and there was increasing recourse to American research and policy initiatives in regenerating the cities.

To make the case for the method, the article follows a historical example: the use of indigenous hydraulics with Roman provenance on the Canal du Midi in 17th-century France. Women labourers brought hydraulics techniques derived from Roman principles to the canal, but their work was not considered classical. Ironically, the Canal du Midi was promoted in propaganda campaigns, defining France as the New Rome, but the peasant women who actually carried Roman culture in their eyes and hands were not socially elevated enough to be New Romans, so they were written out of this story.",sociology

The social relations of work, whether directly or through their economic impact, shape every aspect of our existence. To discuss labor globally might come close to requiring a discussion of everything. Understandings of capitalism as a global system, and perceptions of labor’s orientation as necessarily internationalist, also go back at least to Marx and Engel’s Communist Manifesto and the First International. This article limits its ambition by concentrating on important claims of transformation (roughly) since the 1970s. After introducing some general overviews in the next section, the article is organized (somewhat arbitrarily) into three related themes. The first theme involves claims of globalization as a spatial reorganization, with sections introducing literature on globalization as responsible for a labor’s disempowerment, especially in the (Global) North, works on global value chains, and works on labor in the (Global) South. The second theme involves claims of the emergence of a “new economy” as a social transformation of labor markets, work and workplaces, and changing prospects for labor’s agency and strategy. Here the sections consider “big-picture” claims of the division of labor and economic transformation, more qualified depictions noting continuities and possibilities for labor resistance, and more-specific literatures on the proliferation of precarious labor and the connections between free and unfree labor. Finally, the third theme considers the implications for labor organizing. Typically, attention focuses either on the need for labor internationalism or on new strategies more appropriate to the new economy. The emphasis on depictions of restructuring in the last few decades and rethinking labor’s situation means that not only the long history but also several modern issues are dealt with only in passing. Perhaps most conspicuously, more could be said of labor migration, which is covered in an existing article; see the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Sociology article “Immigration.” Similarly, although several listed texts emphasize the gendered nature of change and the connections between paid and unpaid labor, readers should also see the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Sociology article “Women’s Employment and Economic Inequality between Households.” This article also largely avoids referring to country-specific studies, although many of the most influential early texts based their analyses of change on the United States.</p>",sociology

Sexuality is undeniably shaped by gender as an individual, interpersonal, and institutional force. It is also shaped by intersecting axes of difference including class, race, ethnicity, age, and body morphology or disability status. These are in turn also affected by sexuality. The study of gendered sexuality has been an interdisciplinary undertaking. The sociological field incorporates insights from anthropology, feminist philosophy, gender and women’s studies, history, LGBTQIA+ studies, cultural studies, media studies, psychology, and queer studies. Early sociology failed to recognize sexuality as a domain of social study, so the subject only gained relevance in sociology in the second half of the 20th century. Touchstone texts from the subfield’s formation often draw on non-sociological works as well as biological, medical, and psychoanalytic approaches. Newer advances in the study of sexuality were initially spurred by feminisms and activist-scholars from the lesbian, bisexual, and gay liberation movement. As such, alongside theoretical development and empirical study, some work in the discipline retains a normative approach, seeking to clarify and advance varying definitions of sexual liberation. Contemporary sociological research on sexuality focuses on resultant inequalities: whether between genders (mostly still conceived of as either men and women) between sexual orientations (mostly still understood as either straight or gay) or between different races or ethnicities. As such, sociological study on sexualities focuses on the collective consequences of sexuality as a varied and changing institutional and normative force.</p>",sociology

Marx, Weber, and Durkheim’s interest in societal changes was inspired by the rise of market relations and paid work. The classical sociologists studied the growth and spread of paid work in relation to the development of inequality, rationalization, and social cohesion. Since then, the form and content of employment relationships has changed substantially and keeps on changing. The continued interest of sociologists in these developments has culminated in a well-established field of research. This article explores that field of research in three parts. The first part of the bibliography lists textbooks, reference manuals, journals, and national research traditions. The field shows substantial variety due to the constant development of the labor market and employment relations, and due to institutional differences in the architecture of employment relations. The second part of the article focuses on developments in paid work. The following themes are explored: the growth of paid work relationships, the increase in the number of paid work hours, the major changes in the architecture of employment relationships, the effects of paid work relationships on the well-being of workers, and the development of work values and work-hour preferences. The third part focuses on different labor market positions. This section starts with the standard employment relationship and then moves on to its counterpart: unemployment. It continues with workers in nonstandard positions, such as temporary jobs, part-time jobs, jobs with irregular and long work hours, and self-employed workers.</p>",sociology

Transnational adoption changed ideas around family and kinship as children were not only being adopted cross-nationally but also cross-racially. Because transnational adoption quickly began to transgress the race-matching procedures that guided initial intercountry and domestic adoptions, this new form of family making drew both public attention and research interests. This article primarily focuses on transnational adoption to the United States and the controversies, politics, and outcomes surrounding it. Initial research studies in the 1960s and 1970s in social work and psychology began with a focus largely on children’s psychological and social adjustment into their adoptive families before continuing across disciplines such as law; gender and family studies; cultural studies; and sociology. As research continued, attention reflected disciplinary foci expanding from outcome studies to examinations of the effect of policies, politics (domestic and geopolitical), and race, class, and gender. Given the growth of transnational adoption globally, in 1995 the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption entered into force with the goal of securing the “best interests of the child” and preventing child trafficking and other abuses. In recent decades, new sending countries have open and closed relatively quickly, though China remains a major sending country to the United States for the past two decades, while longer-standing sending countries such as Korea have changed their policies, resulting in decreased adoptions to the United States. These changes, along with a growing awareness of the inequalities inherent in transnational adoption and increased consideration for first families, raise new research questions around the future of adoption.</p>",sociology

The process of racialization has shifted racial boundaries, depending on sociopolitical pressures for inclusion into particular racial groups or even the systematic exclusion of people due to social forces such as war or labor market pressures.

Most people have agreed, moreover, that a society is defined by a correspondence between institutions, values and forms of authority, on one side, and internalized norms and agencies of socialization and maintenance of normal behavior, on the other. Very few people today use these words or this general frame of reference, because societies, to a large extent, have disappeared, fallen into pieces or faded away. We are in a constantly changing world and there is no general, integrated process of change. We live in social settings in which the autonomization of various components of social life is so complete that it is useless to consider them as subsystems. Many sociologists are satisfied with notions like mass culture, individualization, fragmentation or dissocialization processes, or are fascinated by a spreading violence, internal or international wars and our capacity for self-destruction, etc. But this approach is too limited, because it is entirely negative. Thus, a high priority for sociologists is to propose one or various images of social actors collective or individual. But is it possible to propose an analysis of actors completely separate from a theory of social systems? This article proposes a positive answer to this difficult question.",sociology

Later sociologists backed away from this, making sociology acceptable to liberal democracy by being politically neutral. The critics of this solution asked `whose side are we on?' Burawoy provides a novel justification for advocacy scholarship in sociology. Public sociology is intended to have political effects, but also to be funded by the politically neutral state. He argues that public sociology is institutionally neutral, but that committing to an organic relation with a social movement is legitimate as a matter of the sociologist's personal value choice.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0163,"<p>Auguste Comte (b. 1798–d. 1857), mathematician, philosopher of science, grand systematizer of positivism, and in later years founder and High Priest of the Church of Humanity, coined the term sociology, a branch of knowledge he claimed to have established as a positive science. Positive, in Comte’s sense, meant abandoning absolute for relative truth, and the search for the real nature or cause of things, in favor of discovering laws, defined as predictable regularities in the behavior of observable phenomena. Comte’s sociology, divided into statics (laws of social order) and dynamics (laws of historical progress), was integral to his wider positivist system. Its founding completed the “encyclopedic scale” of the fundamental sciences (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, sociology) and made finally possible, he claimed, both a scientific politics and an all-embracing positive philosophy that was destined—following the “law of three states”—to supersede previous worldviews based on theology and metaphysics, together with their corresponding societal forms. Positive philosophy, complemented after the mid-1840s by positive religion, was the cornerstone of Comte’s program for social reform in post–Revolutionary France, and for the global establishment of an industrial-scientific order. Comte’s politics, like his philosophy, aimed to transcend the split between Enlightenment progressives and Counter-Enlightenment traditionalists. In addition to Bacon, Leibnitz, and Hume, he cited both Condorcet and de Maistre as major influences. Although the social sciences have long since abandoned Comte’s search for historical laws together with his wider system and project, the Durkheim tradition bears some of Comte’s imprint as do related currents in French thought like historical epistemology (Bachelard, Canguilhem) and structural Marxism (Althusser). Interest in Comte (influential in the 19th century but long considered a marginal figure) has revived in recent years among philosophers, social theorists, and students of religion, and his voluminous oeuvre has begun to be more sympathetically reassessed. The rebellious elder son of a conservative provincial tax official and a devoutly Catholic mother, Isidore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier Comte was born in Montpellier in the penultimate year of the Directory before Napoleon came to power. By his mid-teens he was a staunch atheist and republican. After winning admission in 1814 to the elite École Polytechnique in Paris to study mathematics and the physical sciences, he was expelled in 1816 together with his classmates after a conflict with school authorities. Following a year studying biology in the faculty of medicine at Montpellier, he returned to Paris, refused the loyalty oath to the restored monarchy that would have readmitted him to the École, and joined the Saint-Simonian circle. He became Saint-Simon’s secretary and principal collaborator until they acrimoniously split in 1824. Between 1826 and 1840 (interrupted by a mental breakdown in 1826–1827) Comte presented a celebrated lecture series, sixty in all, with a number of eminent scientists in attendance. Published in six volumes—the last three devoted to sociology—the Cours de philosophie positive established Comte as a major intellectual figure, winning the support of John Stuart Mill in England and Émile Littré in France. However, his subsequent Systême de politique positive (1851–1854)—with its religious frame, neo-medieval social program and prayerful dedication to Clotilde de Vaux (their tragically short-lived Platonic affair in 1844–1845 had catalyzed his religious turn)—divided his followers and dimmed his reputation. In his final years he continued his writings, including the never completed Synthèse subjective, lobbied rulers including the Czar and Ottoman Sultan for reform from above, and organized his church. Recurrently in ill-health, he died in Paris in 1857.</p>",sociology

In contrast, the sociology of social problems defines social problem differently and adopts a different analytic approach. This approach—sometimes called constructionist—defines social problem in terms of a process, rather than a type of condition. It focuses on how and why people come to understand that some conditions ought to be viewed as a social problem, that is, how they socially construct social problems. Typically, the social problems process begins with claimsmakers who make claims that some condition ought to be considered a problem, that this problem should be understood in particular ways, and that it needs to be addressed. Other people respond to those claims and rework them, so that the social problem is constructed and reconstructed by the media, the general public, policymakers, the social-problems workers who implement policy, and critics that assess the policy’s effectiveness. The process is complex: some claims produce a speedy reaction, while others have difficulty finding an audience. The constructionist approach began to guide researchers in the 1970s and has generated a substantial literature that continues to develop in new directions.</p>",sociology

In the 1970s, feminists focused on sex roles, particularly the socialization of men and women into distinct masculine and feminine roles and the apparent universality of patriarchy. More recent work has critiqued the idea of two distinct genders, calling into question the notion of gender dichotomies and focusing attention on gender as a constitutive element of all social relationships. Gender has been described as a social institution that structures the organization of other institutions, such as the labor market, families, and the state, as well as the social relations of everyday life. In addition, scholars have pointed to the ways in which gender is constructed by organizations and individual interactions. Gender not only differentiates men and women into unequal groups, it also structures unequal access to goods and resources, often crosscutting and intersecting with other forms of inequality, such as class, race, and ethnicity.</p>",sociology

Four key assumptions guide life course scholars’ theoretical and empirical work: (1) lives are embedded in and shaped by historical context; (2) individuals construct their own lives through their choices and actions, yet within the constraints of historical and social circumstance; (3) lives are intertwined through social relationships; and (4) the meaning and impact of a life transition is contingent on when it occurs. Life course scholars also rely on rigorous research methods and data sources—including national censuses, sample surveys, in-depth interviews, and historical records—to document human lives. Because a key question of life course research is “how does historical time and place shape lives?” researchers often compare data obtained at different points in time, from different birth cohorts (i.e., individuals born at different points in history), and from different national and cultural contexts. Researchers also rely heavily on longitudinal data, or data obtained from the same person at multiple points in time, so they can track individual-level continuity and change. Life course research is interdisciplinary, incorporating concepts from sociology, history, psychology, demography, gerontology, child development, and—in recent years—behavioral genetics. The specific foci of life course studies range from social psychological outcomes such as stress, self-esteem, occupational values, and cognitive complexity to family roles, marital and fertility patterns, educational and occupational attainment, retirement, and deviance. Although many life course scholars typically specialize in one developmental stage, such as childhood, adolescence, midlife, or older adulthood, most also consider ways that one life course stage influences subsequent experiences. Most life course research has focused on the U.S. context, yet in recent years the collection of longitudinal data—especially in the United Kingdom and western Europe—has fostered a flourishing of life course research in Europe.</p>",sociology

Given the interdisciplinary nature of media/communication analysis, establishing what falls within media sociology and drawing clear-cut distinctions between sociological and other approaches are not easy tasks. Here, media sociology is understood as research that situates communication and media research within the dynamics of social forces and links them to questions about order, conflict, identity, institutions, stratification, authority, community, and power. The origins of mass communication/media research are grounded in sociology. Not only was it sociologists who charted key themes in the field of communication/media studies, particularly in the United States in the 1920s, but foundational research was concerned with core sociological questions, such as the integrative role of the media in the transition from traditional to modern societies and the community-building dimensions of the media. Around the time of World War II, US media sociology experienced two transitions. Geographically, the center of studies moved from the University of Chicago to Columbia and Harvard Universities, and the research foci changed from news and media to public opinion and mass communication. Analytically, the focus shifted from the relation between media and modern society to questions about war propaganda and persuasion. Given the focus on the dynamics of public opinion, sociological questions about personal and media influence moved to the forefront, and interest in issues related to media and community faded. With financial support from the US government and private foundations, public opinion attracted considerable attention from media and communication researchers in the 1950s. However, as questions embedded in social psychology and behavioral research gained currency, sociological approaches, particularly those focused on structural issues, gradually lost centrality. This shift indicated the beginning of the rift between sociology and media/communication studies in the United States. Sociological theories and questions increasingly became less relevant for mass communication research. The historical trajectory of media sociology has been different in Europe, however. It has not had the focus on public opinion research and media effects that it has in the United States. Instead, it has been grounded in different theoretical paradigms and research questions. Traditionally, it has been more concerned with questions about class, power, institutions, and social differentiation.</p>",sociology

A deeper understanding of the social causes and consequences of climate change is evolving in sociology, yet some of the discipline’s subfields have not responded to climate change. Is this because climate change is perceived to be irrelevant or are scholars suppressing new beliefs that could disrupt the norms of their field? The sociology of the arts provides an illustrative case. This subfield has historically ignored environmental factors, but there is mounting pressure for correcting this oversight and rethinking the beliefs and norms of the field. This article argues that climate change is relevant to the sociology of the arts and that this subfield can become more aligned with the geo-ecological turn in sociology and the SSH. This turn is part of a wider epochal and existential transformation in public consciousness in response to broad changes in society and nature. Changing beliefs about the arts are therefore not explained by endogenous dynamics in the arts field. The article provides a meta-analysis of the geo-ecological turn in sociology and in interdisciplinary arts and cultural research where pioneering arguments have emerged. The analysis uses theory of disciplinary transformation in the sociology of science to analyze largely implicit sociological claims for a transformation of ‘normal science’ beliefs about (1) aesthetic exceptionalism, illustrated by a new conception of music as a study object, and (2) the role of the arts in economic growth. Some implications for the sociology of the arts are considered.",sociology

Sociologists, who should be the go‐to on major policy issues have been sidelined as other social scientists take up roles as policy advisors. Recent efforts aimed at encouraging public engagement have focused on disseminating research and producing more policy‐relevant knowledge. These are welcome resources, but they reflect a deep ambivalence toward policy sociology and a tendency to conflate participation in public discussions with policy impact. In contrast, this essay draws on recent findings about the power of policy experts to develop an organic policy sociology. Organic policy sociology depends on co‐designing and carrying out research with policymakers with whom we share critical and professional commitments. By working collaboratively with policymakers, sociologists can foster equity‐promoting policy, change how policymakers understand social problems, and improve how citizens experience policy on the ground. To that end, I offer six orienting strategies for developing and maintaining organic policy sociology projects, from finding the right partner to assessing the impact of our work.",sociology

This disjunction of the actor and the system led the most radical thinkers to conceive of a system without actors, dominated by determinisms and impersonal powers, and others to describe actors without a system, constructing in a normative void the forms of their interaction with actors who were strangers. Homo sociologicus, exalted by political philosophy, has disappeared. The globalization of the economy, which has entailed a weakening of the social and political controls that existed at the national level, has led in return to the development of identity politics which no longer defend a function but a being, not a project but a memory, which contradicts the evolution that has long defined modernity. We cannot establish a link between the system and the actor unless the latter is defined by the construction of his or her own liberty and not by the playing of specific social roles, and the former as a civil society in which the collective conditions of individual freedom are created.

Recently, Hirschman and Garbes issued a call for an economic sociology of race, wherein they contend that race and racism are not central to economic sociology and that economic sociologists don't engage with contemporary race scholarship. In this paper, I assess and build upon their call. I argue that while the article importantly calls for understanding race and racism in economic sociology, in practice, it—used here as an example of a broader pattern within economic sociology—re‐centers whiteness and men, reifies elitism, and erases marginalized scholars and their contributions. I set forth an alternative perspective. To rise to the Du Boisian challenge, scholars need to critique racialized modernity as Itzigsohn and Brown importantly argue. We must also root our sociological consciousness, citation practices, and conversations in existing, yet marginalized, research. Failure to do so means future research risks reproducing inequities in the discipline and continuing to marginalize the very people, theories, and research that an emancipatory sociology is meant to address.",sociology
10.1177/003803850203600402,"This paper clarifies and develops some of the arguments put forward by W.G. Runciman in his 1998 Sociology article ‘The Selectionist Paradigm and Its Implications for Sociology’. It intends to support his basic claim that mechanisms analogous to (but not synonymous with) natural selection are an important way of understanding both continuity and change in social systems. Nonetheless, it questions the emphasis of his discussion and extends his analysis of two substantive points. The argument proceeds in two stages. The paper begins by examining the many objections that Runciman rebuts and showing that many of them do not need rebuttal but are simply irrelevant to the selectionist paradigm. By irrelevant, I mean that the objections are logically flawed or simply do not apply to the selectionist paradigm as Runciman defines it. The purpose of this part of the paper is to sharpen the debate, so that attention can subsequently be focused on a smaller number of relevant objections that remain. The remainder of the paper attempts to open that debate by discussing the two relevant objections that appear most forceful. It attempts to show that, on closer examination, both objections are mistaken. The first objection is that human deliberation makes any analogy with random mutation in biology untenable. The paper argues that in fact selection and deliberation are complementary. Selection will continue to act on social practices to the extent that our models of the world are imperfect and our practices have unintended consequences. The second objection is that while selectionism is interesting, it may be irrelevant to sociological practice. The last part of the paper provides a more detailed analysis of an example used by Runciman, the task of explaining differing levels of male lethal violence across societies. This analysis suggests that while Runciman’s ‘discursive’ selectionist analysis (like functionalism) can generate suggestive hypotheses, appropriate techniques will be needed to transform those hypotheses into models which sociological research can ultimately test. It is argued that multi-agent computer simulation is a particularly suitable technique for representing evolutionary processes in social systems thus allowing selectionism to be put on the same sort of footing as other ‘middle range’ explanations like game theory and social network analysis.",sociology

The article shows that reflexive endless translation is necessary for all of us, not only for Japanese sociologists but also sociologists all over the world. In this context, the article stresses the importance of Gerard Delanty’s analysis of the relationship between cultural translation and modernity.

Entrepreneurial opportunities are discovered in markets and organizations; how these opportunities are pursued results in different forms of entrepreneurship, such as independent start-ups, licensing activity, corporate ventures and spin-offs, and nonprofits. Entrepreneurship is therefore an engine of innovation and job creation that results in changing the distribution of wealth and fostering the well-being of individuals and groups in society. The field of entrepreneurship research is composed of interdisciplinary perspectives initially drawing from the social sciences. Because entrepreneurship is inexorably linked to institutional processes and organizational forms, the discipline of sociology has been and still remains central to the development of entrepreneurship research. In the early 21st century, considerable resources have been devoted to the study of entrepreneurship, and this momentum points to an increasing variety of research perspectives. Although this article takes a sociological view, it also includes selected works of authors in the sister social, management, and financial sciences that borrow sociological concepts or that more fully flesh out the relevance of the sociology of entrepreneurship.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0025,"<p>We outline four identity theories typically employed by contemporary social psychologists: personal identity, role identity, social identity, and collective identity. Personal identity (see [Personal] Identity Theory), the most elementary of the four identities, was pioneered by American sociological social psychologists (SSPs), particularly Sheldon Stryker. SSPs emphasize how demographic, social, and cultural factors affect human social interaction. Personal identity is what makes every person unique, defining them through their specific biographies (e.g., name, birthplace), unique characteristics (e.g., intelligent, athletic), role identities (e.g., daughter, employee), and particular combination of private and public experiences. Role identify (see Role Identity Theory), also pioneered by American SSPs, particularly George J. McCall and J. L. Simmons, is inspired by the language of dramaturgy. Role identity is defined as the role (or character) people play when holding specific social positions in groups. It is relational, since people interact with each other via their own role identities. Social identity (see Social Identity Theory), pioneered by European psychological social psychologists, particularly Henri Tajfel and John C. Turner, emphasizes how a person’s cognition, affect, and personality traits affect immediate person-to-person social interactions and vice versa. It is the part of an individual’s self-concept formed through the knowledge of his or her membership in meaningful social groups and organizations (e.g., Kiwanis Club, the Cleveland City Club) and categories (e.g., Native American, northerner). In short, it is through our public selves that we are able to simplify the world around us by using categorizations to infer our similarities and differences to other people. Finally, collective identity (see Collective Identity Theory), also pioneered by European psychological social psychologists, especially Alberto Melucci, is the self in action. Collective identities are especially important to social movement participants, political activists, and others banding together to fight for or against social change by working on shared goals and action plans. In short, it is a process by which a set of individuals interacts to create a shared sense of identity or group consciousness.</p>",sociology

These forms of self-criticism become ever more acute in terms of their potential effects as huge transformations in university funding regimes are brought to bear on the social sciences. But none of these critiques engages satisfactorily with what is a much more foundational and serious set of problems, namely the very nature of sociology itself as a historically-situated form of knowledge production. Sociology claims to know the world around it, but in Britain today much sociology seriously fails in this regard, because it operates with radically curtailed understandings of the long-term historical forces which made the social conditions it purports to analyse. A sophisticated understanding of the contemporary world is made possible only by an equally sophisticated understanding of very long-term historical processes, precisely the sort of vision that mainstream British sociology has lacked for at least the last two decades. This paper identifies the reasons for the development of this situation and the consequences it has for the nature of sociology’s knowledge production, for its self-understanding, for its claims to comprehend the contemporary world, and for its apparent social ‘usefulness’.

The hidden mourning about the passing of this ideal science gives present philosophical approaches to science and scientific method their common stamp. The alternative seems to be the retreat into a sociological relativism. The paper shows that it is possible to work out a science-theoretical paradigm which avoids the pitfalls of both philosophical absolutism and sociological relativism. It suggests that instead of discussing criteria of a fictitious absolute end-state of knowledge, one might try to discover criteria and conditions for the advance of knowledge, non-scientific and scientific. A theory of this kind has the added advantage that it can be tested by, and can serve as a guide for, empirical studies of sciences and of knowledge generally.

I argue that counter‐revolution was instigated during the revolutionary crisis (25 January–11 February 2011), accrued momentum during the extended transitional period (12 February 2011–30 June 2013) and achieved a decisive victory after the military coup of 3 July 2013. I interrogate the varieties of counter‐revolutionary actions in these periods: repression and propaganda, adopting a project of containment during the transitional period, then launching unlimited repression campaigns against revolutionaries, and expanding military rule.

The hidden mourning about the passing of this ideal science gives present philosophical approaches to science and scientific method their common stamp. The alternative seems to be the retreat into a sociological relativism. The paper shows that it is possible to work out a science-theoretical paradigm which avoids the pitfalls of both philosophical absolutism and sociological relativism. It suggests that instead of discussing criteria of a fictitious absolute end-state of knowledge, one might try to discover criteria and conditions for the advance of knowledge, non-scientific and scientific. A theory of this kind has the added advantage that it can be tested by, and can serve as a guide for, empirical studies of sciences and of knowledge generally.

Sociology of corruption as a subfield failed to take off despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon. In recent years, new books have been published, including an updated version of Professor Alatas's work. Studies of corruption remain a prerogative of the political scientists and public policy experts. Economists see corruption as a market-distorting externality and treat it as a peripheral subject. Gunnar Myrdal, who was an exception, in his Asian Drama, identified corruption as a serious bottleneck for Asian development. The problem persists 40 years on from Myrdal's analysis. In many countries in the developing world, corruption has become part of the fabric of society. Yet, sociological theorization and empirical studies are lacking.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0093,"<p>Despite copious studies on the middle classes, there is no single, widely held definition of the middle class. Some scholars define the middle class in terms of the relation to the means of production, others in terms of relative incomes, and still others in terms of consumption patterns. A common working definition might include those with incomes in the middle third of the income distribution; who work as upper- or lower-level managers, professionals, or small-business owners; who graduated from a four-year college or university; and whose primary source of wealth is home ownership. The sociological study of the middle classes has a long and varied past and has been driven by both theoretical and empirical concerns. Theoretically, much attention has been given to conceptualizing the historical middle classes in relation to other social classes and also accounting for the emergence of the new middle class in the latter part of the 20th century. Neo-Weberian and neo-Marxist theories of class represent two influential perspectives on the middle class. Both perspectives emphasize the importance of market capacities in shaping life chances and how the middle classes differ from the working class and the upper class on this dimension. Neo-Marxist arguments differ primarily in their additional focus on the relationship to the means of production as a key dimension of the class structure. A third influential approach to studying class structure focuses on the role of tastes, consumption patterns, and cultural boundaries in defining class relations and identifying the middle classes. Empirically, the literature on the middle class addresses the structural forces shaping the emergence of the middle class in different national contexts and how the political, economic, and social trends of the time shape the experiences of the middle class. Since the late 20th century there has been considerable attention given to analyzing the “new middle class” and uncovering in what ways members of this class differ from other classes in terms of political orientations and activities. Other work has focused on how the changing economic landscape of the postindustrial economy has led to economic uncertainty for many members of the middle class, causing an increase in consumer debt, bankruptcies, and downward mobility. The notion of social reproduction and middle-class advantage (vis-à-vis the working class) is a theme running throughout work examining the education system and studies examining religion. Additional topics of research on the middle class include the intersectionality of gender, race, and ethnicity; the importance of geospatial dimensions of space and place; and cross-national comparative work and case studies of various subpopulations and nations.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0231,"<p>Across studies of racialized modernity, critical scholars since W. E. B. Du Bois have recognized that no analysis of racism is complete without studying the social dynamics surrounding whiteness. To be sure, studies of racism frequently center on racially subordinate groups——in terms of the discrimination they experience or, worse, as the source of racial inequalities and social problems. Scholars of whiteness, however, turn their attention to the myriad ways this fictional social construction works to reinforce white power, privilege, and wealth at the level of everyday, institutional, and global experience. Notably, though the term invokes ideas related to skin color, whiteness refers more specifically to a structural position—that is, to a racialized social identity that is positioned as superior relative to other “races” within a system of racial hierarchy. Indeed, because race is socially constructed—and not biological—whiteness can be understood as the result of social and cultural processes, rooted in a global history of European colonialism, imperialism, and transatlantic slavery, and maintained today through various institutions, ideologies, and everyday social practices. Whiteness embodies both a material reality—connected to the disproportionate economic and political power wielded by those racialized as white, as well as a symbolic reality—shaped by the cultural meanings attached to whiteness as a form of inflated value, morality, aesthetics, and civilization. White people thus derive both literal and psychological advantages from whiteness through societal norms, traditions, and institutions—conditions that mask and obscure the unjust nature of white domination. Indeed, the ideological component of white supremacy is profound: whiteness is regarded as the norm or standard in society, and yet the advantages that racial dominance accrues to white people are widely unacknowledged and ignored by white people. Du Bois perhaps cut closest to the core, describing whiteness as something that acquired an almost religious character in the modern world. As he wrote in his 1920 essay “The Souls of White Folk”: “I ask soberly: ‘But what on earth is whiteness that one should so desire it?’ Then always, somehow, some way, silently but clearly, I am given to understand that whiteness is ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen!”</p>",sociology

Since then, the phenomenon has gained widespread attention with advocacy and media campaigns, a flurry of new laws and celebrities taking on the cause of fighting modern-day slavery. The UN protocol defines trafficking as a set of actions (recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt) that if undertaken by one of a set of specified means (threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person) results in exploitation. The protocol notes that at a minimum, exploitation includes “the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.” If the victim is under eighteen, the means become irrelevant. Exploitation comes in many forms and in many industries—sex, factories, construction, fishing, domestic labor, to name a few—and involves men, women, and children alike. No country is unaffected. The subject of human trafficking is the province of many academic disciplines as it touches on a variety of areas of inquiry including migration, human rights, women’s rights, border security, prostitution, and labor rights. At the same time, it also has a strong history of being rooted in advocacy. In fact, much of the early research on human trafficking was carried out by advocacy organizations and journalists who brought much-needed attention to the issue. Scholars were relative latecomers to the game. However, over the past decade, scholarly research has exploded in volume and increased in quality as both qualitative and quantitative methods have been applied to better understand the phenomenon and its manifestations. The works contained here are a guide to the major issues in human trafficking and are intended to be accessible to students, academics, practitioners, and advocates.

The concept was coined by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu to explain educational inequality in France. His concept covers a wide variety of cultural resources, such as verbal facility, general cultural awareness, aesthetic preferences, information about the school system, and educational credentials. In later writings Bourdieu suggests that what he calls cultural capital should in fact be called “informational capital.” His point is to suggest that culture (in the broadest sense of the term) can become a power resource that socially differentiates insiders from outsiders. This inequality occurs when cultural resources become objects of struggle. The concept gained traction early in educational research, in which it has been used to explain differential achievement in schooling. As a measure of family background, the importance of cultural capital relative to income and other possible stratifying factors has become the object of considerable research and debate in the sociology of education. But the concept has been imported into many other substantive areas, such as culture, consumer tastes, family, organizations, and stratification to such an extent that today it is found across a broad range of the social sciences and now figures as an important concept in introductory sociology textbooks. And the concept has provoked criticism and debate relative to how it is measured, its effects, its distribution, and variations in different national contexts.</p>",sociology

Once a marginal area in the social sciences, social movement studies grew into a main field of study in sociology and a significant one in other proximate disciplines, such as political science, anthropology, geography, history, and psychology. This growth was accompanied by significant shifts in the ways in which social movements have been addressed. Before the 1970s, especially (but not only) in the United States, social movements were conceived of as forms of collective behavior, different from “normal” behavior because of high emotionality and, often, anomic syndromes; in Europe instead, especially the main historical social movement, the labor movement, was addressed within a Marxist perspective, with attention paid to the structural conditions for its development. Since the 1970s, both approaches were shaken by the spread of new forms of protest. First of all, in the United States, studies on the civil rights movement showed that it was neither irrational nor anomic, being instead guided by strategic behavior and strong normative systems. Social movement organizations started therefore to be seen as actors that mobilize resources in their environment for collective action. In Europe, the emergence of the student, the women’s, and the environmental movements were considered as examples of new social movements, bound to substitute for the increasingly institutionalized labor movement. Class-based approaches were therefore supplanted by an attention to emerging collective identities. Social movement studies in the 1970s and the following decade focused mainly on macro-level political opportunities for protest and organizational forms and strategies at the meso level, with only limited attention to social structures and individual commitment. Since the 1990s, this structural bias was then challenged by a renewed attention to various cultural aspects, as well as to the causal mechanisms that intervene between structure and action in a field redefined as contentious politics and covering social movements as well as revolutions, democratization, and other contentious phenomena.</p>",sociology

In the first section, I give a brief history of U.S. gun culture from the founding era through the 1960s. Guns began as tools of necessity in the colonies and on the frontier, but evolved into equipment for sport hunting and shooting, as well as desired commodities for collecting. The second section examines these recreational pursuits which formed the core of U.S. gun culture for most of the 20th century.

This article outlines the main features of the debate and suggests various lines of analytical development which may help to resolve a number of remaining conceptual issues. Orientalism has been defined as a discourse which produces the orient as an object of power and knowledge. The discourse has a number of major themes: it provides an explanation of oriental stagnation, offering covertly a legitimation of western supremacy and colonial power; by categorizing oriental politics as despotic, because the orient excludes individualism, it offered a critique of mass democracy; and it contrasted the rationality of the occident with the sensual irrationalism of the orient. While the critique of orientalism in the 1970s was intellectually and morally important, there are some basic problems of epistemology in this tradition which are unresolved. The anti-foundationalist epistemology of the critique of orientalism often covertly relies upon a notion of the `real' orient, but it cannot offer an alternative discourse to conventional perspectives. The article argues that cultural globalism may challenge rather than support cognitive relativism because the idea of separate and different cultural traditions cannot be maintained. The conclusion examines possible developments in the sociology of Islam which may avoid the privileged stance of conventional perspectives on other cultures.",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0037,"<p>Nationalism has been defined in a variety of ways, but definitions are always rooted in the nation, which most scholars agree emerged during the transition to the modern industrial age, supplanting monarchies and other kinds of prior communities and groups based on kinship or tribal ties. Initially, scholars saw nations as based on primordial attachments that were understood to exist as “given” through birth into a particular geographic community or ethnic group. This understanding has evolved into a view of “imagined communities” in which nations are based on a sense of attachment to one another among individuals dispersed across space and time and likely never to meet each other but who share customs, language, traditions, culture, or residence within a set of borders. Because these attachments are imagined by individuals and groups of individuals, neither nations nor the identities attached to them can be understood as essentialized, stable, or static. Instead, nations today are thought to be imagined, constructed, and negotiated. Nationalism exists in these moments of imagination and construction of the nation, which take many forms. The simple expression of national identity, efforts to make political and national units congruent, or xenophobic treatment of outsiders in favor of those deemed to belong to the nation are all examples of nationalist forms. Nationalism can be official and ceremonial (as in the singing of national anthems at presidential inaugurations) or banal (as in the quotidian nationalist symbols people encounter in their everyday lives, from national flags in school buildings to postage stamps displaying national heroes). Over the last several decades—particularly since a resurgence of interest in nationhood in the 1980s and 1990s—the focus of research has been on elite perspectives—that is, how the nation is mediated and constructed through parliamentary speeches, presidential speeches, or public school textbooks and curricula.

It discusses the overlapping principles of this sociological tradition, and gives an overview of the intellectual ambition of its founder, Norbert Elias, best encapsulated in<jats:italic>The Civilising Process</jats:italic>, and some examples of the ways in which his ideas have been tested, refined, refuted, and expanded by subsequent generations. Overall this work retains a marginal outsider status in the sociological canon, but not in sport. Elias, with Eric Dunning, established the case for understanding sport as a thoroughly social and sociological phenomenon and their work was a significant breakthrough in this regard. The development of research by figurationalists of sport since the 1980s is also previewed here, demonstrating that figurational sociology was not tantamount to an analysis merely of violence and aggression, in sport and society. This corpus of work on sport has not only contributed to understanding figurational sociology itself but has made important contributions to other areas of knowledge and has also impacted positively on the work/ideas of other theoretical and disciplinary proponents of research on sport.",sociology

We briefly summarise the various ways in which historically `nature' has been conceptualised, including the connections between the `natural' and the `market'. We suggest that there are many `natures' and then proceed to develop an agenda for a sociology of such natures. This comprises four elements: a sociology of environmental knowledges; social variation in the reading of natures; a sociology of the diverse forms of environmental damage; and a more general examination of environmentalism and society. We conclude with an examination of the relations between culture and nature suggesting that changes in this relationship now demonstrates what has always been the case, namely, that nature is elaborately entangled and fundamentally bound up with the social and the cultural. As the social and the cultural are both rapidly changing provides deciphering that relationship immensely fruitful but complex areas for future sociological work.",sociology

With its self-destruction, the sociology of culture had also receded in modern sociology, becoming an outmoded notion. However, systematic attention to ethnic cultures appears to have regained its role once more and is today actively pursued as a global discipline. Without directly evaluating these contemporary, often empirical, lines of social research, the paper starts first with the reconstructive task of remembering a tradition by considering the works of Albert Salomon, an emigrant sociologist of culture at the New School (1934-1966). Secondly, in the `ex-centric' way of a centre lost, Salomon becomes a main centripetal figure, offering an integrating but open constellation of thought for a sociology of culture. By unifying the philosophy and ethics of Stoicism with social phenomenology, his historical analyses become keys for an interpretive sociology of social action. Salomon's works are seen in the deepest sense to provide a methodology for a sociology of culture which centres in a type of `written art' or `cultural scriptology'. His whole project is finally viewed in terms of contemporary questions of social trust and trusting in symbolic faith.",sociology

Taken together these influences led to a progressive process of displacement as first, the original `dynamic' connotations were discarded such that `motive' was equated with `the reason' or `the reasons' for acting, and then second, identified with `justifications' and `excuses'. The arguments advanced to support these changes of usage are then considered and shown to be in part dependent on selective interpretations, or to rest on contestable claims concerning the contexts in which actors might discuss motives and the role of actor-accounts in action.

As a contribution to the reformulation and further development of Beck's approach to sociological theory, the article seeks to suggest other ways in which the link between risk and reflexivity might be pursued.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0153,"<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a conceptual distinction between “sex” and “gender” arose in the clinical literature on human psychosexual development. Sex came to signify the biological or bodily component of difference, that is, male and female. Gender, on the other hand, came to signify the social or cultural component of difference, that is, masculine and feminine. This sex/gender distinction, as it is often called, was heartily embraced by many feminists of the day who sought to account for differences between the sexes as well as explain and remediate women’s second-class status in society. The establishment of gender as a distinctly “social” concept appealed to feminists because it opened up an intellectual and political space—a space beyond biological determinism—for inquiry into the causes of “male domination” and “female subordination” that were not essential, universal, or fixed. In this space, social change was possible; gender relations could be reconfigured. To that end, the sex/gender distinction became, by and large, paradigmatic in feminist thought and social science, and from it grew a burgeoning body of gender theory loosely characterized as the social construction of gender. Intersectional, post-structural, postmodern, and queer schools of thought produced new insights and advanced theory in ways that posed challenges to the viability and utility of gender as a concept as well as to the sex/gender paradigm. The ensuing debates were highly productive, ushering in a new era of social theory on the body that centered corporeality and embodiment and that sought to deconstruct binary thinking. As thinking on sex/gender evolved, the conceptual split was no longer understood as a simple separation between the biological and the social. Feminist and queer scholars problematized the distinction, reformulating it as an interlocking set of relationships: the sex/gender/sexuality system. Interdisciplinary gender scholars, including prominent feminist scientists, began theorizing the complex interrelationship between sex and gender with greater sophistication in an attempt to more firmly discredit biological determinist approaches to the study of difference based on sex, gender, or sexuality. Advancing theory, research, and praxis has not only deepened understanding about a wider variety of identities, experiences, and practices around sex, gender, and sexuality but has also won greater recognition in the early 21st century for them. This multiplicity of sexes, genders, and sexualities has brought with it unique methodological concerns in the social sciences, which represent a new frontier of research and activism in gender and sexuality studies.</p>",sociology

After defining what a global sociology is, I will point out two particular directions for this sociology: supplementing the postcolonial approach with an anti-authoritarian one, and theorizing post-secular society. One cannot but acknowledge the scars of the colonial era, but postcolonial studies have been rightly used but also abused. I would identify two abuses: the over-emphasis on external factors while neglecting local ones, and the binary logic of antagonistic categories such as East/West, universalism/contextualism. Thus, I make the call to supplement the postcolonial approach with an anti-authoritarian one. There are three levels of authoritarianism: one relates to the political regime; another relates rather to neoliberalism; and the third concerns attitudes. The authoritarian attitude is closely related to the difficulty of dealing with religion in our society. Global sociology should take into account in any contemporary analysis of society the new features of our post-secular society, a sort of low-key secularism in confluence with neoliberalism. In light of these two directions, I would like to see global sociology moving forward. But what should the features of this global sociology be?

Though foundational accounts of citizenship situate the sources and boundaries of civil rights, by far the most frequent usage of the term is in relation to the US civil rights movement, which has served as the central case informing prevailing theories of social movements. The movement’s canonical status and sweeping impacts on political, economic, and social life has given rise to a loosely bounded conception of an associated era, with much scholarship focusing on the contours of racial discrimination and mobility in the “post-civil rights” decades that have followed. Another area of movement influence relates to the encoding of civil rights protections in legislation and court decisions. A particularly robust literature has engaged with the implementation and enforcement of various provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as its impact on subsequent related legislation, such as the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act. The legacy of the movement is also evident in its influence on subsequent civil rights movements, both tactically and through their ability to advance “civil rights” claims in familiar and resonant ways. The unique and familiar character of the civil rights movement, then, has ensured that conceptions of civil rights remain prevalent within a variety of sociological literatures––from social movements, to organizations, gender, race and ethnicity, and the sociology of law––while perhaps paradoxically discouraging focused research on the definitional and political contours of the term itself.</p>",sociology

Key issues concern how population aging influences retirement patterns, income security, health care, and politics, and how these trends, in turn, affect the policy options available. Social gerontologists recognize, however, that old age is just one life stage and that the quality of later life is determined by events, opportunities, and decisions made earlier in life. Thus, many studies in this field adopt a framework that emphasizes the life course as a way to make sense of long-term trends and to explain differences among groups on the basis of race, gender, class, and ethnic origin.

The sociological study of gender and work emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, as women’s labor force participation rates rose and as the Women’s Movement began calling attention to gender inequality at home and on the job. The field has evolved over time; conceptual frameworks have expanded and empirical foci have shifted in response to economic and societal changes. Early research focused primarily on workers and sought to determine whether and how men and women differ in their work attitudes and behavior. Over time, researchers have paid more attention to the social relations of work. Studies here focus on how the structure and culture of the workplace shape men’s and women’s social interactions and behavior. A more recent stream of literature in the gender and work area views gender as embedded within work structures and organizations. In this view, gender is not just an attribute that people bring with them to the job, but is built into the workplace itself. The development of new conceptual frameworks has been accompanied by new issues and topics. For example, the rise of the highly feminized service sector prompted an interest in the distinctive characteristics of these jobs. As dual-earner families became the norm, researchers increased attention to the ways that gender shapes work-family relations. Other topics, such as those related to gender discrimination and inequality, have been of interest to gender and work scholars since the field’s emergence in the 1960s.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0266,"<p>Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is an approach developed in the field of science and technology studies (STS) to avoid purely social and purely technical explanations for scientific and technological developments. ANT offers the departure point of symmetrical constructivism, where there are no primordially social or technical domains, only socio-technical hybrids. As such, ANT is a crucial instigator of a wider turn away from human-centric perspectives in social research. ANT decenters humans by offering an ontological outlook where all actors, humans included, are constituted through their heterogeneous relations with other entities. According to ANT, agency is not a human privilege, but something that emerges in networks of relations between humans and nonhuman alike, thus the name actor-network theory. ANT emerged in France and the United Kingdom in the early 1980s and its influence on STS in the following decades is hard to overestimate. Early ANT brought forward relational, processual, and constructivist studies of scientific practices and technological development. Since around 1990, ANT has been taken up in a wide range of contexts, as the thematic sections below illustrate. This broadening is sometimes associated with the label post-ANT, which signifies a more explicit engagement with the entanglements of multiple practical ontologies, and ethical and political concerns in ANT research, often in conversation with feminist STS and other post-structuralist approaches in the humanities and social sciences. Today, ANT approaches are at work across many scholarly disciplines and fields, where ANT tends to play the role of a heterodox and sometimes even implicit background rather than an explicit theoretical or methodological school. In response to this, the present annotated bibliography seeks to strike a balance between guiding the reader toward classic ANT texts and including some of the trajectories of research that have followed on from ANT in more or less manifest ways. It is not uncommon to omit the label of ANT even in key ANT texts. For example, a central contributor such as Michel Callon refers to the “sociology of translation” instead of ANT. As this lack of fixed vocabulary illustrates, defining the boundaries of the ANT literature is a never-ending task that only has temporary, partial solutions. The aim of this bibliography is not to claim exhaustiveness, but to provide a solid guide for students and researchers who need starting points, either for engaging with ANT in general, or for encountering work within their specific fields of study that have engaged with ANT.</p>",sociology

Following the Industrial Revolution, the people who sold their labor for survival in the newly emerging modern societies were usually labeled as the “working class” or the “proletariat.” Originally used by Romans to label citizens with very little or no property, the term “proletariat” was adopted by Karl Marx to categorize the working class in the newly industrialized European societies, and since then the two terms have been used interchangeably. The initial dominance of industrial work made the working class synonymous with manual work. However, as service-sector employment expanded and the number of people employed in white-collar occupations increased, the definition of “working class” also changed. Today, although there are serious debates and disagreements about the definition of “working class,” or even its very existence, many scholars define the term as comprising people who earn their living through wage labor, who do not own any assets or capital, and who do not possess workplace authority. Over the years, scholars have argued that working classes differ from the rest of the societies they belong to with their politics, culture, family structures, and the conditions they live in. However, it is also not possible to talk about a single and unified working class in any society, as working classes are divided through the lines of gender, race, and ethnicity.

It has become a focal point in the analysis of a variety of sociological questions, as well as in broader public and policy debates. The conceptual framework of citizenship in the work of T. H. Marshall (see Marshall 1950, cited under Historical Origins and Trajectories), whether endorsed or critically appraised, constitutes the starting point for much of the scholarship on citizenship. Inspired by Marshall, the scholarship shifted away from a purely legal understanding of citizenship to include concerns about social and economic inclusion, and later to questions of belonging and participation. Predominant conceptions of citizenship denote (a) membership in a polity (the nation-state), (b) a set of rights and duties that this membership carries with it, and (c) exercise of rights and obligations, and participation in the polity by members. National citizenship, the rights and duties it entails, and the identity it professes have come under significant duress as a result of the global hegemony of political and economic liberalism, particularly since the collapse of the polarized world system. Much of the work in the sociology of citizenship has developed in response to these global challenges. While a significant number of studies occupy themselves with the changing individual and collective relationship in the welfare state and in the broader context of human rights, others focus on questions of belonging and participation in a world where nation-state boundaries can no longer be taken for granted.

What is commonly understood as feminist theory accompanied the feminist movement in the mid-seventies, though there are key texts from the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries that represent early feminist thought. Whereas feminist theories first began as an attempt to explain women’s oppression globally, following a grand theoretical approach akin to Marxism, the questions and emphases in the field have undergone some major shifts. Two primary shifts have been (1) from universalizing to particularizing and contextualizing women’s experiences and (2) from conceptualizing men and women as categories and focusing on the category “women” to questioning the content of that category, and moving to the exploration of gendered practices. Thus, while many theorists do focus on the question of how gender inequality manifests in institutions such as the workplace, home, armed forces, economy, or public sphere, others explore the range of practices that have come to be defined as masculine or feminine and how gender is constituted in relation to other social relations. Feminist theories can thus be used to explain how institutions operate with normative gendered assumptions and selectively reward or punish gendered practices. Many contemporary feminists look beyond the United States to focus on the effects of transnational economic, political, and cultural linkages on shaping gender.</p>",sociology

Public sociology proves to be a rather precarious pursuit, then; first, because of competing demands internal to the academic field; second, because of the difficulty in operating at the intersection of the academic and political fields; and third, because of the obduracy of common sense that cannot be easily dislodged, the very attempt often arousing open hostility. Difficult though it may be, the development of its public face will be necessary for the survival of sociology as well as an important ingredient in defending human existence from extinction by market fundamentalism.",sociology

Others prefer a psychoanalytic reduction, concerned as they are with discrediting his pessimistic version of the future of western civilization. But few have been interested in bringing to light the clear tension in his scholarly work between sociological theory and social theorizing. In what follows, I offer an interpretation of Weber's work based on just such a distinction. That Weber refused to `leave his post' and speak to the first principles which the western project presumes, when these principles were not his own, had serious consequences for him. In effect, one of Weber's greatest accomplishments is precisely the way he speaks to the limits of sociology while staying true to those limits.",sociology

However, less attention has been paid to ideological influences on campaign finance reform and other forms of expenditures. As a result, the sociological understanding of the role of money in democracy has great potential for development. This paper suggests that the new institutionalist perspective, particularly when treating ideas as a causal force, allows for a stronger understanding of campaign finance reform's impact on the public sphere. It does so by linking campaign finance law, political organizing, and campaign spending, specifically for the purpose of political advertising, together. The<jats:italic>Citizens United v.

Current research indicates although White antiracism constitutes attempts to negotiate privilege, it fails to divest from the systems of power that maintain the current balance of privilege in favor of White supremacy. In contrast, the antiracism of people of color provides some insight into attempts to secure liberation, a complete break from White supremacist power structures. I argue DuBois, Black Feminist Thought, and postcolonial sociology inform a sociology of antiracism that centers people of color rather than Whiteness. To illustrate the nuance of antiracism by people of color, I centered my study on Black antiracism. From this perspective, antiracism emerges as the set of practices that Blacks enact in everyday life to mitigate and confront hegemonic racialization. I suggest that one construct of<jats:italic>hegemonic whiteness</jats:italic>meant to uphold dominant racial ideology that produces<jats:italic>emphasized blackness</jats:italic>that facilitates symbolic and physical violence toward Blacks.

Among its integral features is an antipathy towards the systematisation of its ideas. This antipathy has allowed the developing perspective to maintain contradictory positions on important issues. In particular, there is a contradiction between the sociology's phenomenalism, which stresses the need to faithfully reproduce the social world as it is known by its inhabitants, and its essentialism which searches for the underlying properties of social order. A limited solution to this discrepancy is offered in the form of the suggestion that sociologists of deviancy should focus their attention on the ideas of social structure which are held by the people whose behaviour they describe. Sociological maps of these ideas would permit the perspective to manage some of the issues that currently cause confusion.",sociology

On one hand, when going social, semiotics seems more interested in analyses of social artifacts or texts than social life processes in their sociality and not just textuality. On the other, when going semiotic, sociology tends to appropriate formal understandings of structure, only to realize that structuralist efforts are impractical for complex explanations of social life. To overcome these challenges, the chapter proposes integrating two main traditions of meaning-making from the outset: Saussure’s and Peirce’s semiotics. Thus, to lay solid foundation to sociocultural explanation we need a sophisticated theory of signification in social life. A theory where signs—vehicles of meaning—signify via self-referential differentials but also via reflexive indexicalities that anchor them at multiple social levels. Expanding on these themes, the chapter turns to three open problems at the crossroads of semiotics and sociology, namely indexicality and context-making, habituation and power, and culture and cognition. Finally, the contributions are outlined. From different perspectives, each contribution attempts to provide elements to answer: Is there a space for semiotics in an agenda that pushes interpretive sociology forward?</p>",sociology

I argue for a placemaking research agenda that bridges insight from US Urban Sociology with Global Urban Studies to consider how various structures and actors constrain and facilitate place projects.

It will be argued that Britain is not necessarily experiencing a rise in corruption, but a change in its actual nature. This is characterised in terms of a move from `primary' to `secondary' corruption. By continuing to employ a primary conceptualisation, there is a danger of developing a radically misinformed, even corrupt, perspective on the recent `rise' in corruption.

The article suggests two strategies for analysing the relationship between social capital theory and conceptions of liberal-democratic government. In the first section the concept of social capital is interrogated in terms of its political imagination. This is pursued by way of a comparison of the assumptions and norms of social capital and political culture theory - the latter being a perspective that shaped post-war political analysis. The second part of the article situates social capital in relation to the Foucauldian literature on government.

Simmel’s relative neglect in sociology for the better part of the century as well as his recent revival with the rise of the new cultural studies and the postmodern paradigm shift hint at an important interdependence between the history and systematics of sociological theory. The theme of money has not managed to be accepted as an undisputed topic of sociological reflection because of its non-independent status in most social theories (apart from Simmel’s) as well as the factual resistance to totalizing accounts (like Simmel’s) in the history of sociology. Recent transformations in social theory, however, indicate that money may, and to some extent already has, become a more autonomous topic of inquiry. In conclusion, I argue that Simmel’s work does lend itself to be taken up in postmodern perspectives and that the sociological study of money can likewise be appropriated by the new cultural studies. However, these new perspectives will have to come to terms with the modernist resistance of Simmel and the other sociological classics’ remaining influence in contemporary sociological theory.",sociology

Prior to that, men engaging in crime was the norm, and women who engaged in crime were seen as anomalies. Criminology scholars started to think of gender and crime differently, recognizing how the vastness of this topic could lead to opportunities in this previously under-researched area. Researchers began examining issues related to inequality, differences in offending between men and women, and female victims of male violence. In the 21st century, scholars often focus on intersectionality, taking the effects of race/ethnicity, class, sexuality, and other factors into consideration. Furthermore, research on gender and crime also examines the different pathways men and women have into crime. Consequently, it is important to research prevention and treatment programs that address female offenders’ unique needs, including histories of childhood trauma, mental illness, and substance abuse.

Second, global sociology, paying special attention to southern theory and the “epistemologies of the south.” Along with the struggles for the decolonization of the university, this process is redefining the field in non-Eurocentric terms, locating histories of colonialism, enslavement, appropriation, and dispossession at the center of modernity; and interrogating as well epistemic violence/injustice in relation to the constitution of sociology as a discipline. Finally, decolonial struggles taking place outside the university, led by Indigenous and Black peoples and communities. These struggles usually understand the concept and praxis of decolonization in ways that exceed the “social justice framework.” Thus, they allow us to free ourselves from a modern/Eurocentric horizon of liberation, and to transform our sociological and political imagination accordingly.",sociology

That fall he began studies toward the MA degree in sociology at the University of Chicago. Initially influenced by W. Lloyd Warner, his 1949 master’s thesis gave an ethnographic analysis of the responses of cosmopolitan middle-class women as they refused to take entirely seriously the demands of the Thematic Apperception Test that Goffman administered. His doctoral dissertation, “Communication Conduct in an Island Community” (1953), was based on fieldwork in the Shetland Islands sponsored by the University of Edinburgh’s Social Anthropology department. In it Goffman first introduced the term “interaction order” to describe the domain of social life established by co-present persons. This was the sociological terrain he made his own. The investigation of the properties of the interaction order provided the thread that ran through the disparate topic-matters of his eleven books and more than a dozen significant journal articles. Goffman stayed another year in Chicago following the successful defense of his dissertation, drafting an original monograph (The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, first published in 1956 in Edinburgh) and papers on face-work, embarrassment, involvement, and deference and demeanor.

Supporters of caste enumeration argue that census categories merely reflect existing divisions and that it is necessary to link caste identity with inequality. Opponents point to the past experience of mobilization around officially recognized identities and the consequent dangers of both distorted data and increased social tensions. This article argues that while official classifications are important determinants of identity, they are not the sole factor. Ultimately the challenge is to ensure that the right use is made of such statistics.",sociology

The author emphasises that the transition of Soviet society from one qualitative state to another (a state of higher order), and that the optimisation of the functioning of its economic systems is transformed from an ideal into reality only on the basis of an all-round account being taken of the real potential of the human factor through expanding the sphere of operation of the individuality factor. If this does not happen, the process of dysfunctional disturbances in the systems becomes irreversible, and stagnant and negative phenomena become social facts.  From the author's point of view, the task of the sociology of restructuring consists in revealing concrete mechanisms for the coordination of system qualities (those existing, being improved or newly created) and the individual social and psychological qualities of personalities, revealing mechanisms contributing to the optimal combination of objective and subjective, general and individual factors for the social and economic development of the country.",sociology

To demonstrate this approach, I build on the use of metaphor analysis in sociology, cognitive anthropology, and cognitive linguistics to analyze a field whose fictional expectations have a significant impact on the global political economy: elite professional advisory firms.

This ar ticle examines how eroticism has been viewed as a source of life-affirming meanings and as personally and socially destructive.

The `social life of things', however, is more varied. Drawing on Alan Page Fiske's theory of the four fundamental models of human relationship, four ways in which people may relate to each other and to things are distinguished; these models are applied to empirical data from a study on the giving of gifts in the Netherlands.

The three experiments illustrate that, while many worlds (consisting of objective and subjective structures) exist, they tend to collapse into a few through “echo effects” produced by the powerful; these powerful echo effects are counteracted by the evolution of Spirit or Collective Consciousness growing more enlightened; and the more individuals reconnect with Spirit, the more echo effects are transformed into resonances, pointing to the pluriversal future that permits many worlds to co-flourish.

I illustrate how men's diverse institutional roles surrounding medicalized experiences of infertility are critical for understanding inequality in reproduction. Situating research on men and infertility in the theoretical framework of gender as social structure shows how men's secondary position in reproduction can be seen across institutional roles, which include men as patients, men as partners, men as sperm donors, and men as doctors. Men's experiences with reproductive medicine often reinforce men's marginal position in reproductive medicine through institutionalized arrangements; yet, men are intimately and structurally involved in reproductive decisions. I argue that bringing gender to the center of research on infertility could make clear the many structural ways women and women's bodies are controlled, regulated, and treated by reproductive medicine.",sociology

It is marked by the emphasis on social processes, human agency and the dimension of time. These aspects of social reality become central foci of 'new historism' or 'historical sociology'. With the ascendance of this new trend the relationship of sociology and history enters a third phase: after initial hostility and mutual stereotyping through attempts at external integration, it reaches a phase of immanent integration. From ahistorism typical of early nineteenth century European sociology, as well as early American sociology, our discipline moves gradually toward the recognition of the historical coeflicient of social phenomena, and accordingly the necessity of historical perspective in social studies. Historical orientation is recon structed as a set of six ontological and six methodological assumptions, and it is suggested as a fruitful approach not only to traditional macro-structural problems, but also to the domain of micro-structures and micro-processes.",sociology

Complex experiences often leave behind residues or ‘traces,’ and contributors in a recently edited volume challenge sociologists to unlock the social significance of these traces and find new ways to capture what our methods capture so poorly, namely, popular forgettings, geographies of exclusion, and the slow erasure of deeds, memories, and other subjugated knowledges belonging to individuals who find themselves dismissed, dispelled, or disenfranchised by nation-states. Traces left behind by individuals navigating the complexities of contemporary experiments in human ‘being’ are just the sort of analysis that must, in principle, place the actor at the center of analysis, and, after careful study, we now appreciate that despite the analytical ease of assuming that actors are singular, sociologists should examine actors as plural and unearth their essential multiplicity.",sociology

Researchers appear to be obsessed with what are mistakenly seen as cosmopolitan issues.  The author identifies a number of different perspectives from which one can explore the possible future of the sociology of work: the organization of the profession, its academic-scientific structure, and trends in work and in social demand for the discipline.  The author argues that to ensure a positive future for both the sociology of work and the societies in which it is practised, sociology must regain its role in the definition of sociological problems and so prevent the conscious ideological trivialization of the discipline.

This not-so-tacit arrogance only further privileges the university as the primary site of knowledge production, while rendering invisible the many knowledge producers outside the academy. As public sociology continues to curry favor with mainstream media, politics, and policy institutes, it reveals a steadfast faith in the state and capital, while obscuring radical alternatives. In turn, public sociology functions as a counterinsurgency tool via professionalization. Conversely, a counter-public sociology refuses to comply with oppressive state protocols.

Mead: A Critical Introduction, which has the twofold goal of introducing Mead's thought to a new generation of scholars and inspiring a scholarly debate concerning the significance of his work in modern social science. The discussion acknowledges the originality of Da Silva's conception of Mead's thought as a system that develops in and through a dialogue with other thinkers. Nevertheless, this dialogue is shown to be inadequate as a strategy for reconstructing Mead's social psychology, which did not rely solely upon philosophy and psychology. The focus is brought to bear on Da Silva's uncritical acceptance of authoritative opinion concerning the main sources of Mead's inspiration, among which not even a single sociologist is mentioned. The essay argues, on the one hand, that Blumer's symbolic interactionism compressed two quite different traditions into one — a view adequately supported by evidence. Meadian scholarship then continued to conflate and subsume under `Mead' what may be termed the micro-sociopsychological tradition, as found in the pioneering works of Cooley, and what may be termed the macro-sociopsychological tradition of Mead himself, to which the former gave impetus. The essay also maintains that the origin of Mead's theory cannot be properly understood outside its indebtedness to the sociological climate in America at the turn of the 20th century, which was conditioned by the social and psychological ideas of such thinkers as Jane Addams and Freud. The conclusion is drawn that if the relationship between symbolic interactionism and modern social theory is to be understood, then the area of research should be extended from the main canonical gallery, in which Mead deservedly has a place, to what may be described as the `minor sociological gallery' of Simmel, Tarde, Addams and Cooley, which at present remains in the background.",sociology

In the first instance, it is contended that a comparative, intercultural tendency has played a determinant, albeit relatively neglected, part in the development of social research in the modern West; this tendency, which is identified as the `ethnological imagination', has enriched and can continue to enrich sociological thinking.

The founder’s disciples and adherents often lose this perspective, fighting to suppress alternative readings and undermining the theoretical synthesis attempted by a classic thinker. To flesh out this thesis, the paper examines the place of Erving Goffman in Chicago sociology and the ingenious way he blended various strands comprising this tradition. The discussion starts with the debate on what constitutes the Chicago school, after which it moves to the knotty relationship between Goffman and symbolic interactionism and his determined effort to accommodate structuralist premises within process-oriented sociology. An argument is made that Goffman followed the lead of his mentor, Everett Hughes, in casting social institutions as “going concerns” that run the gamut from large scale formal organizations to taken-for-granted collective enterprises which are honored in the breach. Several empirical studies developing Goffman’s theory of total institutions are reviewed to flesh out his brand of structural interactionism. The paper concludes with reflections on the retroactive nature of reconstructing a school’s origins, problematic practice of assigning sociologists to a specific paradigm, and the affinity of Goffman’s sociology with the classical inquiry into a dialectical relationship between agency and structure. The case is made that Goffman’s research on the institutional moorings of human subjectivity places him firmly in the classic sociological canon and forms the core of his intellectual legacy.",sociology

Less work has gone into developing analytic categories that allow us to capture the complex imbrications of technology and society. This article addresses two particular aspects of this challenge through two organizing efforts. First, understanding the place of these new technologies from a sociological perspective requires avoiding a purely technological interpretation and recognizing the embeddedness and the variable outcomes of these technologies for different social orders. These technologies can indeed be constitutive of new social dynamics, but they can also be derivative or merely reproduce older conditions. Second, such an effort will, in turn, call for categories that capture what are now often conceived of as contradictory, or mutually exclusive, attributes. The article examines these two aspects by focusing on three analytic issues for sociology: the embeddedness of the new technologies, the complex interactions between the digital and the material world, and the mediating cultures that organize the relation between these technologies and users.",sociology

The main methodological foundations of application of Bayesian approach in statistics are briefly reviewed: the use of priors in analysis, features of Bayesian statistical inference, differences in frequency and Bayesian confidence intervals, features of hypothesis testing in Bayesian statistics. A Bayesian model of a comparative binomial experiment has been constructed. It supports comparison of independent and dependent samples of binomial variables, and also allows for differences in sizes of the compared samples. The capabilities of the model, as well as the principles of the Bayesian hypothesis testing, were demonstrated on test data using PyMC and ArviZ, contemporary free packages of the Bayesian modeling and analysis. The use of these tools allows implementing direct tensor operations with the obtained posterior distributions and provides the researcher with an effective way to calculate the effect size when comparing two binomial samples without having to resort to complicated forms of calculating this parameter. The possibilities and limitations of the Bayesian approach are shown in the context of comparative analysis of the results of binomial experiments in social sciences by estimating the probability of hypotheses via finding and comparing the area of intervals of posterior distributions",sociology

Despite their significant role in the processes of neighborhood communication and the construction of local communities, this phenomenon has been little comprehended by social science. The purpose of this article is to offer variants of adaptation of some sociological approaches to the analysis of the phenomenon of neighborhood chats. The nature of neighborhood chat as an institutional and communication-oriented tool for information exchange is described. The classification of neighborhood chats according to the level of their closeness is given. The forms of control in the selection of participants in closed versions of neighborhood chats are explained. The communicative side of neighborhood chat is proposed to be considered through the prism of E. Goffman’s “dramaturgy”. Conceptualizations of the basic concepts of “dramaturgy” in the context of digital neighborhood interaction are proposed. The complicated nature of neighborhood chat as a technological and social phenomenon is analyzed using the actor-network theory approach. The identification of neighborhood chat as an “actor-network” has been substantiated. The functional side of neighborhood chat as a mechanism of assemblage of neighborhood communities is considered in correlation with R. Oldenburg’s concept of the “third place”. It is shown that the neighborhood chat, being rather a digital simulation of the “third place”, can potentially compensate for the lack of real public spaces in the conditions of typical development, launching and supporting the processes of integration on the locality.",sociology

Marx's critique of the ahistorical errors and alternative emphasis on the historical character of social system constitute the theoretical unifying theme of his social studies.

Using bibliometric records from 14 political science and sociology journals over the last two decades, this study demonstrates that protest has witnessed a resurgence of interest in political science and that both sociology and political science now share a focus on the outcomes of protest. The article lays out key trends in this research agenda and suggests what is missing, arguing that a political sociology of protest should integrate recent findings from both disciplines to better understand elite decision-making, the mediation of protest information and protestor aims.",sociology

No longer a stepchild of the serious business of sociologists, the arts are, if not central, then at least a legitimate, as opposed to a frivolous subject. This flowering has come about despite a traditional anti-aesthetic orientation in American social science, and, until recently, relative retarded development of much contemporary European social science. Still, the position of the arts in the social science disciplines is likely to remain tenuous, and requires renewed justification as an intellectual enterprise. The reasons for this have to do both with the intellectual outlooks that have become embedded in understandings of the arts, and the social structures of their creation – or ‘production.’ The most promising developments in sociology are fostered by recognition of many more genres of creativity and their incorporation in the aesthetic domain. This growth is related to socioeconomic and political trends, consumerism, industrial transformation of global scope, though is not reducible to them.

10.1093/obo/9780199363445-0100,"<p>Having emerged in the 1970s as public awareness of and concern for environmental problems increased, environmental sociology’s main goal is to understand the interconnections between human societies and the natural (or biophysical) environment. Environmental sociology has been described as comprising four major areas of research. First, environmental sociologists study the social causes of environmental problems. Along these lines, scholars have developed an array of theoretical frameworks to explain how various social factors, including demographic, social, cultural, political, economic, and technological dynamics, generate environmental impacts and problems, and they have conducted many empirical studies on a wide range of environmental indicators to assess hypotheses derived from these theories. Second, environmental sociology is concerned with how the natural environment influences and impacts society. Early environmental sociologists strongly emphasized the dependence of human societies on the natural environment and stressed that the field should consider how the environment shapes society in addition to how society impacts the environment. Research in this area tackles issues such as the social consequences of natural disasters and the inequitable distribution of environmental hazards along racial and socioeconomic lines. Third, environmental sociology examines social reactions and responses to environmental threats and problems. Research in this area focuses on understanding patterns and trends in environmental attitudes and behaviors (e.g., recycling) as well as various aspects of the environmental movement. Fourth, environmental sociologists are concerned with understanding social processes and dynamics that could advance environmental reform and sustainability. In general, environmental sociology has tended to focus more on explaining how society causes environmental problems while paying less attention to potential solutions, but a shift has taken place in recent decades. The development, discussion, and empirical assessment of theories of environmental reform, analyses of potential solutions to environmental crises, and drafting of conceptual frameworks for sustainability have become important foci of scholarly activity in environmental sociology. Another major area of research, one that cuts across the preceding four, is the human dimensions of global climate change, which has become one of the main substantive issues studied by environmental sociologists. In this article, important scholarly works in each of these five areas are highlighted and briefly discussed, along with a selection of the most relevant textbooks, handbooks and collections, encyclopedia and review articles that provide general overviews of the field, and academic journals that publish environmental sociology research.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0203,"<p>Beginning with many of its earliest writings, sociology has a long tradition of theorizing the role of objects and material culture in social life. In the middle of the 20th century, these themes were taken up again by major sociological and anthropological thinkers who inspired a resurgence of interest in the study of objects. The sociology of culture and art began to address the production and reception of objects, while scholars from anthropology, cultural studies, and media studies began to develop a robust body of work around material culture. These two fields have somewhat different takes on the study of objects. Sociological accounts tend to be people focused, examining how institutional characteristics of art worlds shape the objects produced, and focusing explanations of meaning-making on the social position of the audience more so than the symbolic qualities of the object. Alternatively, material culture approaches tend to be object focused, engaging objects as symbols that help explain how people organize subcultures, create solidarity through exchange, or express social status. A turn toward materiality, originating from anthropology but taken up more recently in sociology, privileges the material qualities of objects and how they shape the use and symbolic meaning of objects. This work on objects raises the question of how sociologists should incorporate objects into accounts of action. This question has sparked an ongoing cross-disciplinary debate about whether objects have agency. Research in science and technology studies, alongside studies of craft and sport, have brought attention to how objects act back, shaping how knowledge is produced. Objects have also been understood as mechanisms of power, by shaping categories and morality, ritualizing icons, stabilizing social relations as instruments of the states and institutions, and structuring action through the built environment. These robust and vibrant areas of research make a strong case for the incorporation of objects into theories of power and knowledge.</p>",sociology

This article shows how Kelsen mounted a polemic against Durkheim, on the basis of a first-hand knowledge of his writings. Kelsen believed that Durkheim committed several errors. In particular, he interpreted Durkheim’s famous sentence according to which ‘social facts must be treated as things’ as a clear sign of a materialistic, deterministic and positivistic attitude which neglects the power of ideas and norms. Schmitt targeted sociology by way of a criticism not of Durkheim but of Léon Duguit, who had been inspired by Durkheim and pleaded for a collaboration between legal scholars and social scientists.

10.1177/0011392120907639,"Academic disciplines are defined not primarily by their object but by their (theoretical and methodological) approach to that object, and by their claim to a monopoly over it. Even where that monopoly claim has been highly successful, it remains contestable. For example, economics, perhaps in this respect the most successful social science, finds its object – the economy – contested by political economists and economic sociologists. Whereas economics has successfully marginalized potential competitors, sociology has remained a broad church. Attempts to impose theoretical and methodological order on the discipline have met with resistance, and eventually failed. Moreover, sociology has never really reached consensus on what its object is; ‘society’, ‘social facts’, ‘social action’ were the classical options, with the list growing over time (social networks, rational action, actor networks, etc.). Thus, while we can speak of ‘heterodox economics’ there is insufficient orthodoxy to speak of ‘heterodox sociology’. This has an obverse side. Precisely because of the weakness of its monopolistic claims, sociology has been very productive in spawning new disciplinary fields, which, rather than remaining within sociology’s weak gravitational pull, successfully establish themselves as separate disciplines or ‘studies’. Criminology, industrial relations, urban studies and organization studies are the most obvious examples. In light of this, this article addresses two questions: (1) What happens to these new fields when they break free of the parent discipline, and to the parent discipline when they do?

10.1093/obo/9780190922481-0016,"<p>Urban sociology is among the earliest and richest areas of sociological inquiry. It touches on topics and problems related to the way urban areas develop and the way people live in urban areas. While most of the attention of urban sociologists has been on more contemporary urban settings in Western societies, they’ve shown increasing interest in urban development and urban life in so-called developing countries and the Far East, especially India and China. By nature an interdisciplinary pursuit, five major academic fields contribute to urban sociology: anthropology, economics, history, political science, and social psychology. Specialists in these respective disciplines read and cite each other’s work and borrow from each other’s theoretical insights. One major profession, urban planning, is affiliated with urban sociology. It, too, has its own entry in Oxford Bibliographies in Geography: “Urban Planning and Geography.” Other Oxford Bibliographies touch on themes discussed here. Among them are “The Chicago School of Urban Sociology,” “Suburbanism,” “Gentrification,” “Residential Segregation,” “Community,” “Urban Economics,” “Social Movements in Cities,” and “Riots.” Given the rich disciplinary sources that feed into urban sociology, this area of inquiry probably can be best understood by the themes that allow researchers to connect the disparate kinds of studies they do. The several sections into which this essay is divided have works that reflect one or more of the following four themes: (1) Urban sociologists focus on either the physical development of urban places (i.e., urbanization) or the way of life or culture practiced there (i.e., urbanism). (2) The work of urban sociologists asks how urban places are built and laid out as cities and metropolitan areas. It also asks how urban settlements might be rebuilt or developed so they better serve or complement the way people live there. (3) Some sociologists look at smaller groups of urban dwellers or venues in urban areas such as neighborhoods (i.e., “micro” studies) and other kinds of “communities” such as those one might find in a suburb. Others look at much larger geographic landscapes such as metropolitan areas and urban regions (i.e., “macro” studies). (4) Urban sociologists can be optimistic about the prospects for urban places and people or, more frequently, pessimistic about how well they will fare. The resilience and effectiveness of people living in urban settings are more often subordinated to a view of them as part of a marginalized and less well-regarded group, surviving rather than accomplishing much in the places they live, work, and practice politics.</p>",sociology

Municipalities, states, and federal governments see culture—the goods, ideas, traditions, activities, and practices that we produce and consume—as revitalizing communities, attracting human capital and consumers, providing jobs, and boosting quality of life. While artists, support personnel, manufacturers, and patrons continue to anchor the field, because of culture’s entrée into the economic arena there has been an influx of diverse actors and institutions with various stakes and logics. These new actors with a vested interest in the field include local elected officials, small-business owners, and the creative class, as well as national nonprofits, state agencies, and commercial institutions. With the emergence of creativity as an economic growth strategy, there has been a great deal of analysis on the cultural economy in a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to sociology, economics, public policy, city and regional planning, and urban studies. Scholarship has had a wide range in terms of the methodologies used and the scale of analysis. Scholars and policymakers debate over culture as an economic and policy lever, particularly around whom local cultural economies aim to serve and how the benefits of the cultural economy should be distributed.</p>",sociology

This paper examines the somewhat problematic recent trajectories of the RSS as a professional organization and of rural sociology more generally and notes a degree of disciplinary and organizational inertia that have limited the pursuit of new directions. It also presents a discussion of selected factors that have contributed to these concerns, including both “external” factors that are largely beyond the organizational reach of RSS and “internal” factors that are more directly linked to organizational characteristics and actions. Drawing upon the distinctions between “red ocean” and “blue ocean” strategies outlined by market strategists Kim and Mauborgne, the discussion then shifts to a focus on action alternatives that, if pursued, could help to create an expanded set of opportunities and a brighter future for rural sociology, and for the Rural Sociological Society.",sociology

Sociologists often view happiness as a problematic, subjective phenomenon, linked to problems of modernity such as consumerism, alienation and anomie. This construction of ‘happiness as a problem’ has a long history from Marx and Durkheim to contemporary writers such as Ahmed and Furedi. Using qualitative interview data, I illustrate how lay accounts of happiness suggest it is experienced in far more ‘social’ ways than these traditional subjective constructions. We should therefore be wary of using crude representations of happiness as vehicles for our traditional depictions of modernity. Such ‘thin’ accounts of happiness have inhibited a serious sociological engagement with the things that really matter to ordinary people, such as our efforts to balance suffering and flourishing in our daily lives.",sociology

Nevertheless, there is a lack of conceptual frameworks which relate sociological theory to a thinking about ‘the visual.’ Sociological theory has widely neglected to reflect on images and ‘the visual’ and to explore the role of images in constituting and reproducing ‘the social’. This article argues for a sociology of images. It aims to develop a conceptual tool to analyse images from a practice perspective. Following a theory of practice approach and referring to works in the sociology of science, it suggests the concept of ‘visual logic’ to analyse images sociologically. The article claims that social practice is intertwined with a visual logic. To investigate images from a sociological perspective, the article argues, implies to analyse the visual logic that shapes, and is constituted by, social practices. Taking medical images as an example and drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, the article shows how this concept serves as an analytical tool to explore the social role of images. Physicians and medical researchers use images both because of their visual and non-visual dimensions. The article thus concludes by pointing to a multitude of visual logics – or, in their empirical form, ‘visual rationalities’ – that become evident when observing image practices ethnographically.",sociology

Cross-classification of dichotomies of these dimensions yields four types of research: provincialist (local, unconditional), contextualist (local conditional), generalist (non-local, unconditional) and internationalist (non-local, conditional). Classification of all substantive articles in the top two sociological journals in both countries indicates almost twice as much provincialist research in the United States than in the United Kingdom and little reduction in US sociology provincialism from the level in 1965.

10.1177/00113921241271850,"The most promising perspectives for a transdisciplinary dialogue between economics and sociology may be identified in the sub-disciplinary fields of evolutionary economics and economic sociology. Both share a common intellectual legacy in the differentiation of the social sciences. The economic and sociological work of Joseph Schumpeter provides an outstanding point of cross-disciplinary transgression and reintegration. In this context, this article claims that it is a curious fact that the role of technological and organizational innovation as a driving force of capitalist evolution characterized by disruptive change has become the paradigmatic foundation of related debates in evolutionary economics, but not in economic sociology. Of course, in economic sociology, technological change has been repeatedly covered regarding the social structures and network relations underpinning technological change in various settings of organizations, industries, markets and spaces. Yet the phenomenon of the introduction of novelty as such, drawing on constellations of power and domination in the context of radical uncertainty, enforcing the disruption and reconfiguration of social relations has remained rather underrepresented in the major strands of sociological reasoning on economic affairs. This assessment holds especially for neo-institutionalist reasoning, which emphasizes the drive towards stability in industries and markets, and therefore underestimates the actual characteristic of capitalism an innovation-driven system of persistently radical changes. Elaborating on this concern, this article outlines the basic relationship between evolutionary economics and economic sociology as point of departure for presenting the evolutionary approach to innovation as a promising concept for future reasoning in economic sociology. In conclusion, this implies that bringing innovation back into economic sociology implies a revitalization of Schumpeterian positions while entering a transdisciplinary dialogue with current advances in evolutionary economics and related fields of innovation studies.",sociology

Part of these methodological troubles is seen to be connected with Goldmann's use of a metaphor connecting Piaget's individual/environment distinction with the distinction between social groups and history.

Such a concern, however, risks perpetuating another form of Eurocentrism, one that is responsible for instituting the very distinction between epistemology and ontology, knowledge and reality. By developing a sustained engagement with Boaventura de Sousa Santos’s work, as well as establishing possible connections with what has been termed the ‘turn to ontology’ in anthropology, in this article I argue that in order for sociology to become exposed to the deeply transformative potential of non-Eurocentric thinking, it needs to cultivate a decolonial imagination that may enable it to move beyond epistemology, and to recognise that there is no social and cognitive justice without existential justice, no politics of knowledge without a politics of reality.",sociology

They have helped us, first of all, to understand what an emotion is, the countless number of existing feelings, and the great complexity of emotional processes. Second, they have revealed the social nature of human emotions, and the emotional nature of social phenomena. Third, they have developed a number of theoretical approaches to studying the emotions.

What would a developed sociology of the moral constitution of society look like? It would firstly have to be empirical and not philosophical; secondly it would have to produce an `irritant' and thus a communicative learning process within sociology itself. The necessary condition for this is the interdiction of self-exemption. The proposed correlation between this negative condition and moral communication is refutable only if moral communication could be found signalling esteem and disesteem in which the communicator took the licence of not applying the proclaimed standards reflexively. The division of labour cannot, in itself, be the source of morality because it is ruled by self-exemption. In moral communication, the duality of ego and alter and the opposition of esteem and disesteem are translated into a binary code that opposes positive and negative values and which is acceptable to both sides of a moral dispute as a framework to which they can refer. Codes are invariant but specific; ethical programmes change historically with the structural changes of the social system.

The study of forced migration is linked to research on economic migration, but has its own specific research topics, methodological problems and conceptual issues. Forced migration needs to be analysed as a social process in which human agency and social networks play a major part. It gives rise to fears of loss of state control, especially in the context of recent concerns about migration and security.

When manifesting a vocation, the sociologist is not an acting subject but part of an unfolding presence. Understood vocationally, then, sociology should not be taught as an object with which students are to identify; it must be taught through ascetic practices that suspend the student sociologist’s subjectivity and allow them to find their potential through their relation with an other that is different but not outside.

We make the argument for sociologies of race that go beyond surface level reconstructions, and which challenge sociologists to reflect on how their discipline is presently configured. What the suite of papers in this collection shows is both the resilience of race as a construct for organising social relations and the slippery fashion in which ideas of race have shifted, transmuted and pluralised. It is in a spirit of recognising continuity and change that we present this collection. Some of the papers already stand as landmark essays, while others exemplify key moments in the broader teleology of race studies. This includes articles that explore the ontological ground upon which ideas of race, citizenship and black identity have been fostered and the need to develop a global sociology that is critically reflexive of its western orientation. The theme of continuity and change can be seen in papers that showcase intersectional approaches to race, where gender, nationality, generation and class offer nuanced readings of everyday life, alongside the persistence of institutional forms of discrimination. As this work demonstrates, middle-class forms of whiteness often go ‘hiding in the light’ yet can be made visible if we consider how parental school choice, or selecting where to live are also recognised as racially informed decisions.

The earlier paper argued that the training of undergraduates, and the influence and example of their teachers, tends to orient them, well before graduate education begins, towards particular kinds of research topic and, where empirical data are used, approaches employing no quantification or very simple techniques. It suggested this would be a selfreinforcing process unless there were far-reaching changes in undergraduate curricula which were unlikely to come about. It predicted that the divide between these aspects of British sociology and that practised in North America and many parts of Europe would widen further. British sociology has become somewhat more empirical over the past fifteen years, with the bulk of this expansion in the qualitative area. The more sophisticated quantitative approaches are not much more in evidence than before. This raises a number of questions which should be a matter of debate. It is worrying that the debate does not seem to be taking place.",sociology

From its inception, classical sociology was primarily concerned with the European origins of processes of modernity that were to become global. There was little discussion of how the global might be understood in terms of structures, processes and social movements not directly identified as European but nonetheless contributing to modernity. The challenge for sociology has been to take into account these other phenomena and to rethink its core categories and concepts in light of newly understood alternative formations of the global and the social movements that bring them about.",sociology

Peirce’s concepts, and in particular that which refers to the contextualized evolution of a sign ( semiosis), can remedy this situation by enriching the sociology of markets. Coordination between buyers and sellers is based on a process of transmission and reception of different types of signs: some are stabilized and the interpretation ‘flows naturally’ – these are the conventions well identified by economic sociologists – while others are more ambiguous and leave a great deal of room for indeterminacy. In the latter case, the concept of semiosis makes it possible to finely identify the techniques used by actors to buy or sell in situations of uncertainty. After presenting Peirce’s conceptual architecture, this article illustrates the interest of such an import from a case study centered on the role of stock market indices in the functioning of contemporary financial markets.",sociology
10.1177/0011392108097454,"If the conventional position that sociology emerged in the 19th century is accepted, then two 18th- and/or 19th-century rationalist knowledge conditions — `positivism gives way to theory' and `the centrality of modern rational philosophy' — can be accepted as the conventional knowledge conditions for the discipline's emergence. While acknowledging that this conventional position and these two conventional knowledge conditions form an important part of the story of sociology, this article argues that they should not be accepted as the whole story, or even as the most important part of it. The article presents two counter-arguments by way of a challenge to convention. The two arguments focus on the history of sociology's principal object, `the social'. One contends that the social actually emerged in the early modern era, not in the 19th century, and that, therefore, the discipline has its most significant roots in the period 1550—1700, especially in the work of thinkers more attuned to voluntarist factors. The second argument contends that sociology was only able to blossom as a discipline when the social achieved a significant level of autonomy from the three forces responsible for its emergence — politics, law and the state — something that did not happen until the late 19th century. On the back of these two arguments, the article develops a further argument: that sociology needs to extend its list of standard knowledge factors beyond the conventional two. This argument has it that while these two accurately reflect some important 18th- and 19th-century developments, they need to be supplemented by conditions that allowed the social to make the journey from the early modern era to the later era. The article then goes on to consider four different technologies for `seeing socially' — perspective, the microscope, the camera obscura and ballooning — as additional knowledge conditions for sociology.",sociology

These approaches have sought to release sociology from any residual reliance on the oversocialised conception of the individual that formed part of the legacy of Parsonian sociology. It is the argument of this paper, however, that while structuration theory and analytical dualism focus on the creative powers of human reflexivity, as part of their rejection of the `oversocialised agent', the theoretical weight they place on consciousness neglects the socially shaped somatic bases of action and structure, and results in an undersocialised view of the embodied agent.  If the relationship between socialisation and agency needs analysing in terms of embodiment as much as in terms of the cognitive internalisation of norms and values, however, there are good reasons for structuration theory and analytical dualism rejecting attempts to ground subsequent notions of the embodied agent they may develop in dominant, static notions of the habitus. These minimise creativity and make it difficult to analyse social change. An important challenge for future reconceptualisations of the structure/agency divide, then, is to construct a sociology which recognises the significance for human agency of a socially shaped form of embodiment, yet which refuses to make the embodied actor a mere product of society.",sociology

Thereby, the disciplinary boundary between economics and sociology is reproduced where economic sociology is understood the application of the ‘sociology tradition’ to economic phenomena. This article suggests a change of perspective: economic sociologists should treat economics as an endogenous part of its enquiries, but not to examine what economic theory is, but what it does, i.e. how economic theory shapes the economy. This requires introducing the study of language, concepts and semantic distinctions as an inherent part of economic sociology and its focus on the ‘social’ construction of economic institutions.

The objective is to generate an original Critical Realist Model for Organizational Sociology. This initiative stems from critical realism’s critique of flat ontologies and epistemologies that tend to conflate different objects of reality. The proposed model takes the form of a trialectic generative sequence, highlighting driven objects configured in a specific ontological situation as the necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the emergence of organizations. This sequence includes (a) time-space co-presence and the embodiment process; (b) symbolic community sharing and the identification process; and (c) power dynamics and the processes of representation, delegation, and subordination.

What does it mean to be “non-normative”? Ideally speaking, this connotation structures around a political claiming, a subversive metaphor that does not adhere to the standard gender(ed) expressions. That said, these gender traits challenge the cultural norms, or the dominant languages as historically coined within the medical dictionary. In order to address this, the politics further renders a non-foundationalist approach to gender, as making an attempt to de-objectify any sort of typification of classification. In addition, the diversity and fluidity of it aims to install de-pathologization of identity category, and further, to pacify the rigid gender traits that could potentially make gender more discrete. Thus, its very fluidity establishes an unsettling position of gender and sexual choices, as further to establish anti-imperial, non-hegemonic claim in the US-centric gender positions and theorizations. In lines to this argument, non-normative sexuality studies are an attempt to collate interdisciplinary and non–Euro-American modes of texts, theories, and approaches from the domains of culture, desire, beauty, aging, legalities, medicine, and health, complemented with several dimensions of these disciplines to create a bibliographical space addressing the several bodies, identities, and experiences of these representations.

Although processes of financialisation have meant that extreme indebtedness has been a latent global problem since the 1980s, it was only in the wake of the crash that debt became a manifest systemic issue. This was because it was no longer possible to endlessly defer repayment into the future on the basis of a fantasy of ceaseless growth because it suddenly became clear that the financial system was not good for the debts it had distributed across the globe. Given this crisis, endless finance and repayment projected into the distant future has been transformed into ‘the dead weight of debt’ and led to the emergence of a new class system based upon creditors and debtors. The emergence of this new situation challenges sociologists and policy-makers to think about possible solutions to the socio-economic horror of debt bondage that threatens to destroy the future of not only deeply indebted individuals and their families, but also generations to come who currently stand to inherit a decrepit society that seems hopelessly trapped between a fantasy of endless growth based in financial speculation and a dim recognition of the need for sustainability that finds violent rearticulation in austerity and common sense narratives about the need to balance the books. In this book key thinkers on the topic of debt debate the social, political, and economic, meanings of the state of indebtedness.</p>",sociology

High‐profile risk incidents such as 9/11, the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans have served to underscore the global significance of risk. Although risk has conventionally been approached in the natural sciences as an object to be technically mastered by mathematical probability, since the early 1980s social scientists have focussed on the subjective and social dimensions of risk. This article traces the contours of the ‘turn to risk’ within sociology, outlining the central tenets of the risk society, governmentality and sociocultural theories. Both the utility of and the limits to these theories are demonstrated through practical application. The article concludes by considering some of the problems and contradictions that arise out of the sociological turn to risk.",sociology

Our analysis identified key themes supporting charges of anthropocentrism, but also aspects of politicised animal sociology. Based on this we call for sociological animal studies to incorporate a specifically Emancipatory Animal Sociology: an approach grounded in a social justice and emancipatory praxis that explicitly and critically engages with the material conditions of animals’ lives, taking into account the experiences and knowledge of activists and others working directly with animals and, where possible, centres the animals themselves.",sociology

So it is not surprising that they have always been at the center of sociological research, starting with Marx and Weber. And although Durkheim did not explicitly analyze organizations, his work has clear implications for the study of organizations. We review the insights of these three pioneering sociologists and then discuss ideas about organizations proposed by other scholars, from both management and sociology, from 1910 to the mid‐1970s. Marx, Weber, and Durkheim's theoretical frameworks were tools for understanding the transition to modernity. Marx and Weber saw organizations as sites of class struggle and rationalization, respectively, while Durkheim focused on social cohesion and collective sensemaking, both of which underpin organizations. Later theorists focused more closely on the meso‐level and micro‐level processes that happen within and between organizations. These later theorists emphasized pragmatic concerns of optimizing organizational efficiency and labor productivity (scientific management and human relations theories), processes of affiliation and hierarchy (Simmel), limits to rational decision‐making (the Carnegie School), and environmental conditions that shape organizational processes and outcomes (contingency theories). A companion paper describes the three perspectives (demographic, relational, and cultural) that have dominated sociological research on organizations since the mid‐1970s.",sociology

Considering the predominance of narrative visual metaphors in these approaches' treatment of socio‐technical perception, it is argued that the “turn to sound” in social studies of technology, rather than simply furnishing established analytic approaches with a fresh set of empirical cases (i.e. “sound technologies”), presents an opportunity to better sensitize STS approaches to the contingent socio‐technical shaping and distribution of embodied perceptual modalities in general. A critical review of recent social and historical studies of sound and technology, attending especially to debates surrounding the theoretical shift from acoustemological or soundscape‐based to signal‐oriented “transductive” approaches, suggests the importance for future STS and Sound Studies work of addressing how shared modes of sensory perception are produced within particular socio‐technical frames.",sociology

The chapter argues that, traditionally, the social territory belonged to literature and philosophy. A challenge was then raised by science especially in the nineteenth century. Then, especially in the twentieth century, social science developed so as to turn a binary contrast into a triangular one. Sociology had three sources in Western thought: one literary (political philosophy), one quasi-scientific (the philosophy of history), and one scientific (biology).

We argue that this represents a shortcoming that should be addressed by future scholarship. In order to inform future critical gender–environment theorizing, we provide a brief review of ecofeminism and note promising examples of scholarship that takes power and inequality seriously when accounting for phenomena of relevance to women and the environment.

To reveal these misconceptions, this paper focuses on three common concepts namely conflict, structure and economy. For contemporary scholars, these concepts are said to characterize Marxian Sociology. So, they claim, Marxism is a conflict theory, a structural theory and also a theory of economic determinism. To what extent are these claims true? This paper provides answers by reviewing the original premises of Marxism together with these claims.

The paper will show that such a conception of human identity enables us to improve our understanding of a range of theoretical issues, including the relation between social structure and action and the rationality of human action, as well as revealing the historical roots of a number of long-term trends which are usually treated as changes typical of the second half of the twentieth century.",sociology

Ironically, just when globalisation has been growing in the world, so too have doubts about sociology as an international enterprise. This divergent development between the world and the discipline appears to be the direct result of the demise of positivism. Subsequent theorists have polarised into advocates of `false universalism', e.g. `modernisation theory', `dependency theory' and the post-modernist view of `modernity', all of which assume unitary processes with uniform results - to which international sociology stands opposed. Alternatively they have become celebrants of incommensurable diversity, resting on the assumptions of relativism, which would outlaw international sociology altogether. Instead of endorsing either unity or diversity, the task of international sociology is to specify how global mechanisms combine with regional circumstances, in non-uniform fashion, to shape new trajectories and novel configurations. Globalisation is not merely the effect of the `new' world on the `old': the two together make for a radically different world, which it is the job of international sociology to capture - social theory is never intransitive.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0066,"<p>World-systems analysis (WSA) emerged in the stormy period between worldwide waves of protest in 1968 and the onset of transformative global economic crisis in 1973. Its founders Immanuel Wallerstein and Terence Hopkins, young sociologists of contemporary Africa in New York’s elite Columbia University, studied and worked with major social theorists of the previous generation: Karl Polanyi, Margaret Mead, C. Wright Mills, Daniel Bell, Seymour Martin Lipset, and Paul Lazarsfeld. WSA attacked modernization theory, the reigning political and intellectual orthodoxy of the era, which had predicted and prescribed the progression of all poorer countries and peoples toward the values and institutions of liberal capitalism, American style. Wallerstein and Hopkins argued that poorer countries and peoples were no less “modern” than wealthier ones. They became poor and dominated as a result of the same process of global formation, beginning with the 16th-century “discoveries,” through which selected Western countries obtained their wealth, advanced capabilities, and colonial empires. Undoing the benign assumptions of modernization as universally beneficial progress, WSA pointed to European imperialism as the main source of underdevelopment. Perceived backwardness derives not from old and stagnant local traditions, but rather from the axial division of labor between world zones unequal in wealth, status, and power: core, periphery, and semiperiphery in between. Expanding income, advanced skills, and citizenship rights in the core were historically supported by various forms of slavery and cheap labor across peripheral areas. WSA thus took neo-Marxian theories of capitalism, including arguments about its future demise, to the global plane. The hallmark of WSA is in shifting the principal unit of analysis from separately studied and case-independent “national” countries to the whole world analyzed as a single system containing various regions, markets, and states. WSA focused on globality long before globalization became fashionable. The radical “unthinking” of capitalist logic and “common sense” is the main claim of WSA. After a brief period of great popularity in the late 1970s, WSA was sidelined mainly for political reasons. The global financial upheaval of 2008, however, brought renewed interest in WSA. Its leading scholars, particularly Giovanni Arrighi and his collaborators, had anticipated this crisis by examining earlier instances of economic and geopolitical turbulence arising from world capitalist consolidations and transitional phases of systemic chaos. Other scholars also advanced WSA theories regarding ancient and medieval world-systems; environmental and economic geography; global cities; modern literature in the space of world creativity; the formation and undoing of labor markets; antisystemic movements; the specific mechanisms of capitalist operations such as commodity chains, race, and ethnic conflicts; the collapse of the Soviet empire and its outcomes; and the rise of East Asian industrialism. Moreover, the epistemology of knowledge became a special line of argument pointing to the blinders and institutional barriers that WSA seeks to overcome. In the early 21st century, world-systems analysis extends intellectual alliances in several directions, particularly with historical and political sociology, heterodox economics, and the political economy of culture.</p>",sociology

The gender pay gap can refer to differences in mean or median annual earnings, weekly earnings, or hourly wage. Because women tend to work part-time at higher rates than do men, and because part-time work tends to pay lower hourly wages relative to full-time work, the size of the gender pay gap is affected by whether full- and part-time, full-year or seasonal, and very young and very old workers are included in the estimates. Among full-time, year-round American workers aged sixteen and above in 2017, the gender pay gap (median weekly earnings) was 18.2 percent, meaning that women earned 81.8 cents of every man’s dollar. In the United States, women of color earn less relative to white men than white women do, owing to racial gaps in pay among women; moreover, within-race gender pay gaps are often smaller among racial/ethnic minorities, reflecting the low earnings of minority men. The gender gap has narrowed considerably since the early 20th century, yet disparities in women’s and men’s earnings persist. Moreover, this narrowing has not proceeded in a linear fashion and the gap has occasionally increased. This entry first introduces important literatures on historic and contemporary trends in the gender pay gap and then discusses the various explanations for the persistence of, and changes in, the gap. These explanations highlight the role of occupational gender segregation; the devaluation of female-typed work; gender differences in experience; family structure, care responsibilities, and the gendered impact of parenthood; workplace structures of inequality; glass ceilings and glass escalators.

While there are many viable ways to embed corruption, we advocate a comparative historical sociology of corruption in particular. This approach has in mind a view of corruption as “a moving object,” that is, as subject to variation across social space and transformation over time. It focuses on the processes through which a course of action is worked out in relation to historically specific structural conditions. By tracing these processes and embedding “corrupt” practices in the situations where they were developed and make sense, we gain a deeper understanding of these practices and are in a better position to evaluate them. We are also able to make better comparisons, comparing objects shaped by similar processes rather than objects identified by definition alone. We proceed, first, by situating our intervention in the context of the rise of a disembedded approach to corruption. Second, we review a selection of more or less embedded approaches in anthropology and sociology. Third, we describe what a comparative historical sociology of corruption entails. Finally, we highlight the costs of a disembedded view in terms of ineffective and pathologizing anti‐corruption efforts.",sociology

It also notes the insufficient instruction given to Cuban teachers about sociological issues and the lack of texts that identify the key problems in a clear and systematic way. The investigation concludes with suggestions on consolidating the discipline within the sociological context of contemporary Cuba. Such suggestions include the need for connections between macro- and micro-sociological issues, the need for educational institutions to launch internal studies of themselves and the need for an examination of how changes in educational policy affect society. Such efforts would both contribute to the development of the discipline and to a better understanding of the relationship between education and society.",sociology

This article begins with this ascending significance of the person in the neoliberal world of work, where the personal accumulation of skills and devolution of responsibility to individuals are privileged. Theoretical approaches to personhood attempt to respond to these changed conditions, with the work of Pierre Bourdieu often thought incapable of properly explaining such contemporary phenomena. In response, this article approaches personhood through the frame of Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic capital, those properties ‘misrecognized’ as belonging to the person when they are in fact the product of relations in which the person is enmeshed. A reconstruction of the concept in the sociologist’s work, along with analyses of its implications for a philosophy of perception and for ideology, will show the way for an unexpected approach both to Bourdieu’s own work, reframed through the concept of symbolic capital, and to personhood, which is revealed to be a profoundly and paradoxically relational notion.",sociology

Discursive psychologists, communications scholars, and sociologists have all used this concept. Discursive resources are clusters of categories supplied by culture that present explanations for past and future activities, provide individual and collective identities for self‐construction, and enable and constrain texts. In this essay, I describe how this research contributes to sociological theorizing of identity, and make some recommendations for researchers who wish to use these concepts or improve these concepts. Studies using the concept of the discursive resource contribute to sociological theorizing of identity by showing how discursive resources are related to important features of social life such as future talk; collective identities; space and time; and complex and political divisions of labor, culture, and postmodernity. I then conclude by suggesting that future research analyze the social distribution of discursive resources across different kinds of social environments.",sociology

The reasons for the relative neglect or marginalization of Ibn Khaldūn as a source of theory to be applied to definite historical empirical situations is partly due to the predominance of Eurocentrism in the social sciences. The manner in which Eurocentrism has defined Khaldunian studies is discussed, but the main focus of this article is the possibilities of a Khaldunian historical sociology of Muslim societies that is founded on a non-Eurocentric approach to his work. The article specifies what is meant by non-Eurocentric readings and applications of Ibn Khaldūn's theory. Several illustrations of these applications are provided. The serious consideration of Ibn Khaldūn's status as a founder or precursor of sociology would require such theoretical applications.

Early sociologists, like Auguste Comte and Lester Ward, conceived sociology as a secular discourse, although it transmitted Protestant values that reduced people of African descent to fetish objects. In the work of Charles H. Long, the ‘image of Africa’ appears in the African American religious imagination because it – more than the land in which Blacks were enslaved – authenticated their origins. In my appropriation of the concept, it is a semiotic device that, through its dialectical relationship with the ‘image of involuntary presence’, structures sociology’s narrative form.

We provide an overview of four research areas that have received the most attention in the sociological and anthropological literature of egg freezing: medicalization, gender, temporality and risk, and markets. What emerges from much of the research is the sense that egg freezing has become entangled with cultural imperatives to take future‐oriented responsibility for one's own health, financial, social, and reproductive needs through self‐management, risk reduction, calculation, and optimization.

The five epistemic strategies range along a spectrum from methodological individualism at one end to holism at the other. Between these two poles, considerations of the social relativity of scientific knowledge arise. Constructionist theories highlight the performative dilemma entailed when science reveals itself to be one narrative among others. Hierarchical theories such as Marxism suggest that public sociology is torn by the irreconcilable contradiction between hegemony and counter-hegemony. Heterarchical theories address both of these two problems together. Heterarchy suggests that science’s claim to universality may interfere with public sociology’s social-transformative aspirations. However, the dynamic complexity of ‘public’ social struggles generates opportunities to rethink the place of difference in the production of scientific knowledge.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0038,"<p>Sociologists have long been fascinated with occupations and professions, both as forms of social organization and as the locus for other social processes and dynamics. Social control and cohesion, differentiation and inequality, collective action, power and influence, and identity formation are just a few of the topics considered by sociologists studying occupations and professions. Four strands of literature compose the sociology of occupations and professions, broadly defined. One strand tackles the division of labor, with the goal of understanding how positions in the division of labor are differentiated from one another (e.g., professions from other occupations), and how those differences are maintained. A second examines occupational communities, and, in particular, the relationship between occupational membership and individual behavior. A third strand focuses on the social activity of work itself, including the labor process, employer control of work, alienation and job satisfaction, unionization and its recent discontents, and the rise and fall of skills. Another thread of scholarship considers how occupations become associated with rewards (e.g., pay, prestige, authority, etc.). The field of occupations and professions has diversified methodologically in recent years, opening up new modes of inquiry into some of these topics. Indeed, whereas case studies of particular occupations dominated the field in the latter half of the 20th century, major empirical research in the last decade have included ethnographies, comparative case studies, network analyses, and quantitative analyses of survey data. And, although the pace of theoretical innovation in the “professions” literature may have slowed in recent years, the field remains a vibrant arena for studies of globalization, technological change, corporate reorganization and changes in employment practices, and the emergence of “new” types of work (e.g., service work, emotional labor).</p>",sociology

Most women, irrespective of social class, were dissatisfied with housework — an important finding which contrasted with prevailing views.

Reviewing research about older migrants and minorities, I point to the emergence of undocumented older persons as a demographic group that merits attention from researchers and policymakers. This nexus offers important lessons for understanding stratification and inequality. This review offers new research directions that take into account multilevel consequences of growing old undocumented.

10.1177/0038038582016002004,"The paper explores some of the main strands in the development of the sociology of leisure. The nineteenth century founding fathers, with their synoptic theoretical approaches, found space for leisure, although not labelled as such, as an integral part of their work. Veblen introduced the concept of leisure into sociology, but was himself committed to values of efficiency from which standpoint he criticized the drone-like character of the leisure class. His views were more consonant with industrial sociology which emerged as a strong well-funded sub-discipline dedicated to humanize the labour process while also maximizing productivity. It was from among industrial sociologists seeking a fuller explanation of work-place behaviour by looking beyond the factory that a sociology of leisure was developed. It emerged as a satellite to the sociology of work. The sociology of leisure was dominated, in the post-Second World War period, on the one hand by post-industrialism, and on the other hand by data collection, often on a psychologistic and individualistic basis. The reaction has been to return to more synoptic approaches, often combining elements of marxism, culturalism, history and literary criticism. These approaches have also redressed the balance against the notion that leisure is always a symbol of freedom and progress by re-introducing notions of constraint and social control. In conclusion, it is pointed out that leisure, deriving from the latin `licere', properly incorporates both of these meanings, and therefore raises in another form a fundamental problem of sociology itself. The problem concerns the balance between the individual and the social and between freedom and constraint. In this sense, leisure should be treated as an important and integral part of sociology, and not peripheral.",sociology

Three key strengths of sociological novels are presented: promoting public sociology and interlocutor engagement; transforming knowledge exchange from mimetic to sympractic communication; and addressing issues of scope. Two recent sociological novels are discussed: Blue by Patricia Leavy and On The Cusp by David Buckingham, both published in 2015. Finally, two linked aspects for (thinking about) writing sociological fiction are explored: the concept of glocality and the methodology of ethnography.

Through his emphasis on the practical content of social life, Bourdieu provides a powerful alternative to theoretical critiques of contemporary society advanced by sociologists such as Adorno. At the same time, read against the background of Adorno’s ‘critical theory’, this reflexive move itself appears as a limitation. Due to its emphasis on the conditions of sociological knowledge, reflexive sociology tends to subordinate ‘theory’ to ‘epistemology’ and, therefore, hinders the sociologist from imagining a different society. Read together, Bourdieu’s and Adorno’s works provide important insights about two potential dangers that remain on the path of the sociologist.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0247,"<p>Pioneering work on the relationship between race and sexuality can be dated from the late 1970s. Early academic, political, and artistic work by women of color in particular gave voice to women’s simultaneous experiences of heterosexism, racism, sexism, and so on. Queer of color work broadly theorized the role of race and racism in knowledge, politics, and concepts of sexualities. Historical work on empire, slavery, and colonialism further demonstrated this fact, while contemporarily focused transnational work does the same for early-21st-century processes. Given the importance of intersectional and transnational analysis, research on race and sexuality has become a growing and central feature of sexuality studies. Such research does not treat “whiteness” as a taken-for-granted category of analysis, but instead unpacks how sex, sexuality, and race are always co-constituted. With emerging theoretical lenses such as Queer of Color Critique, the study of racialized sexualities has become crucial to any exploration of sexuality. In addition, studies of race and sexuality look at how they have historically informed and continue to inform one another, in ways that include thinking about empire, Racisms, carcerality, surveillance, criminology, deviance, desire, and changing understanding of the erotic. Both intersectional and transnational work consider multiple racial formations and take into account the multiple genealogies of sexuality studies, centralizing work that is informed by women of color feminisms, transnational feminisms, queer theory, and black feminist thought. To best understand racial and sexual formations, race and sexuality studies allow us to think of the two as always informing one another.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0264,"<p>The subject of urban crime has long fascinated researchers, policymakers, social workers, journalists, and the public. Historically, the subject of crime has been so linked to urban places that the very mention of cities has evoked images of violent slums and fear of victimization. It is common for government officials to publicly politicize and racialize urban crime as they pander to certain blocks of voters. For instance, among his many derogatory comments about cities and urban populations, former US President Donald Trump—a New Yorker—tweeted about needing help with “crime-infested inner-cities.” Why the emphasis on crime in cities? A main reason is that crime is not randomly distributed. Rather, environmental opportunities for crime vary by time and place, and cities tend to have characteristics that increase vulnerability to crime. Though cities vary along many dimensions, including culture, climate, history, politics, and demographic characteristics (e.g., population size, density, racial and ethnic heterogeneity, age structure, and migration patterns), crime rates historically have been higher in urban communities than in rural, suburban, and smaller-sized places, on average. For this reason, many consider cities to be the ideal social laboratory for studying crime. Urban sociology has been essential to the theory and research on crime as a place-based social problem. Research on the spatial distribution of crime has compared different levels and scales of analysis, including samples of cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and neighborhoods (as defined by residents, researchers, or administrative census boundaries). Many studies focus on a single city, or even a single neighborhood. In addition, the urban crime literature covers topics that are quite varied, including different place-based theoretical approaches, concepts, explanations of causes and consequences, and policies. For example, researchers have explored topics related to the impact of neighborhood residential mobility on crime, the consequences of residents’ experiences with crime on their sense of neighborhood attachment, and the ways in which crime control policies affect the distribution of crime and residents’ lives. The books and articles outlined below are not exhaustive, but instead we view them as a curated sampling of the vast range of research on these topics—simply one of many ways to organize the vast amount of work that has accumulated on the important but broad subject of cities and crime.

In this article, based on a relational conceptualization of value, the author calls for a value turn that could open childhood theorization both to new forms of cultural analysis of social processes at the familial, national, and global scales, and to new forms of applied research on policy fronts such as childcare and education policies, civil society engagement, and parenting.

These developments, it is argued here, actually created the form of the social that became large-scale modern western society. This new form of the social was and remains distinct from those older forms that were seen to flow from the natural sociality of human beings. Between the middle of the 16th century and the end of the 17th the new form of the social emerged in different parts of Europe, contingently but not entirely accidentally, as a separate domain of relatively safe and free human interaction. It was a consequence — in part intended, in part unintended — of different bids to secure civil peace in times of extreme inter-communal, inter-confessional violence. These bids included, to name just three measures: the development of new forms of public law, especially in Germany; the development of the absolutist state, especially in France; and the separation of private religious conscience from public legal conscience, especially in England.

The popularity of these unscripted programs merits investigation. Reality shows can be seen as significant cultural objects whose production and consumption reflect and reveal norms and ideologies of contemporary culture. Although what is currently conceived as the reality television genre is perceived as novel, this type of programming has a long history, with its foundations dating back to the early days of television. Despite the popularity of reality television and its solid roots in Western media, sociology has been underused in its analysis. In this essay, I review the research on reality television. Its definition, history, and issues of classification in the genre are addressed. Then, I summarize the major themes in the research: production; analysis of content, presentations of race, gender, and sexuality; and audience response and interaction. I conclude with a discussion of what sociology might add to the existing research.What are sociologists to make of the current wave of reality television? What do these shows and their popularity tell us about society? Despite the editing and packaging of these shows and the way people are turned into television‐friendly characters and prototypes, these programs bear similarities to social research. Many are explicitly or implicitly promoted as ‘social experiments’. Reality shows often cast relatively diverse groups with the intention of seeing whether conflict or harmony will result. Success in reality competitions is often achieved through the development of alliances and strategic relationships and the process by which these unions form can be sociologically fascinating to watch. Yet, sociology, in method and theory, has rarely been applied to the analysis of reality television. This is not to say that reality television has not been examined academically. In fact, there is a growing body of research, primarily conducted by communication studies scholars, that takes this type of television seriously.Research on reality television examines the production and reception of programs. Additionally, there are studies that document the significance of the popularity of this genre in television and popular culture. Other research analyzes the content of reality television, aiming to make sense of communication norms depicted on shows like <jats:italic>Survivor</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Big Brother</jats:italic>. Although many of the articles and books about reality television investigate themes with which sociologists are quite familiar (e.g., identity, stereotypes, social structure), missing from most of the current analyses is systematic use of rigorous sociological methodology, perspective, and theory. Sociology could contribute a great deal to the study of reality television. Certainly, a microsociological, symbolic interactionist analysis of both the content of reality shows and the ways viewers interact with them would be a useful extension to the existing literature. Sociologists have done rich ethnographic research in the study of talk shows (e.g., <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b1"">Abt and Mustazza 1997</jats:ext-link>; <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b30"">Gamson 1998</jats:ext-link>; <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b35"">Grindstaff 2002</jats:ext-link>), and it would be beneficial to have an in‐depth, inside look at the production of reality television, particularly given that its reality is contested. Additionally, sociologists could provide important perspective regarding how reality programming reflects, challenges, and perpetuates existing inequalities, particularly with respect to race, class, gender, and sexuality. A critical understanding of the impact of social structure on popular culture, from a sociological point of view, would add another dimension to the study of reality television, continuing the strong tradition in research on culture that demonstrates how cultural objects have much to tell about social life, values, and ideologies.Sociology has been used to make critical contributions to the study of television. As <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b34"">Grindstaff and Turow (2006</jats:ext-link>) note, sociologists have been instrumental in documenting the significance of television as an industry and important part of the economy, and as a primary medium of distribution of mass cultural products. television has unified generations of Americans, creating media events and spectacles, shaping and reflecting changing norms and conceptions of reality (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b22"">Dayan and Katz 1994</jats:ext-link>).

One key effect of expectations is to enact selective attention, which is evocatively captured by the metaphor of a filter. Drawing on the case of sex and gender, I demonstrate that using filter analysis to identify the specific dynamics of ‘socio-optical construction’ — adding a concrete analysis of visual perception to the general idea of social construction — may help scholars to more effectively account for some of the ‘hard problems’ of constructionist theory, such as the body.",sociology

While this institutionalization is recognized to have been advanced primarily by Arthur Ruppin, there is growing agreement among historians that several authors working more or less parallel to Ruppin greatly contributed to the emergence of the field in Italy, Russia, Great Britain, and Germany and to the emergence of a vast body of research in German, Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew. Although the boundaries between European sociological discourses (e.g., Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss in France or Georg Simmel in Germany) and Jewish sociology are not always stable, scholars widely assent that European Jewish sociology denotes the study of contemporary Jewry with the tools of modern social science. Historians have also documented the unstable boundaries between European and American Jewish sociology (e.g., Max Weinreich, Maurice Fishberg, or Joseph Jacobs). Scholars also agree that similarly to broader trends in Europe connected to the emergence of nationalism, its general context was that of attempts to employ scientific tools for the rationalization of society, and more specifically for finding solutions to social tensions and problems. As such, its generators viewed its primary aim to study and understand the condition and future tendencies of Jews in modern non-Jewish-majority societies. In particular, this included degrees of assimilation of Jews into non-Jewish societies and the measurement of anti-Semitic hostility toward Jews. In comparison with other branches of sociology, Jewish sociology tended to focus on empirical questions and showed less interest in general theoretical or methodological concerns. With Ruppin’s immigration to Palestine in 1908 and his position as a professor of sociology (1926–1943) at the newly established Hebrew University, the center of European Jewish sociology shifted to Palestine.

To minimize the risk associated with innovation, most scholars agree that firms should engage simultaneously in two types of activities: exploring new alternatives and exploiting existing competencies. Firms that simultaneously engage in explorative and exploitative activities are called ambidextrous organizations. Research on ambidextrous organizations, however, inadequately considers the importance of the environment in which organizations operate for innovation success. The sociological view of innovation fills this gap by emphasizing the importance of social context for explaining innovative outcomes. The sociology of innovation highlights, first, the structural arrangements – characteristics of social networks, organizations, and institutions – that influence innovation and, second, the relative nature of innovation – whether an object is considered novel depends on one's vantage point. Drawing on the relative view of innovation, I develop a typology that outlines several paths to innovation with respect to two vantage points: the organization and the environment. I argue that minimizing the risks associated with innovation is most likely to occur when firms follow the path of innovation that consists of generating novel solutions that simultaneously exploit knowledge and resources that are both available to the firm<jats:italic>and</jats:italic>in the firm's environment.",sociology

This article seeks to contribute to debates in this area by advocating a novel approach to questions about music’s relation to the social, one that seeks less to map the social distribution of taste profiles or explore how listeners make use of music’s affordances than understand the variable ways in which music emerges as something to be attended to (or not) in the first place.

This is an approach that advocates a ‘flat’ social ontology in order to focus on questions about the constitution and configuration of musical events. In so doing, the article argues that if we are to gain a better understanding of music’s varied relation to the social, it is necessary to transcend the residual substantialism implicit in ‘new sociology’ and mediation-focused accounts and adopt an approach capable of integrating concerns of object-ness, emergence and attention with questions of power and inequality.",sociology

In the 21st century, however, this condition hampers the adjustment to changes in family relations and in society at large. One implication is the ambiguous position of children, hanging between the private and the public domain, implying specific tensions and dilemmas. Two issues are significant: the division of responsibility for children between parents and collective institutions; and the search of parents and other educators — peers included — to find a balance between external social control and self-control in the formation of the personality of children. Dutch sociological research on children and childhood is scarce and fragmentary, which may be linked to the ambiguous social position of contemporary Dutch children.",sociology

In the 1990s, local administrations and national government promoted new opportunities for children’s participation in society, and sociologists began to analyse the various aspects of this participation. Since the 1990s, sociological research has included the legal and political bases of children’s citizenship and rights, forms of interaction promoting children’s participation, ways of including children in mainstream cultural tendencies, children’s observations of their social context, intercultural situations involving children, deviance and the labelling of children. The expansion of childhood sociology, however, has been slow, and the political impulse which supported children’s participation has partially evaporated. Childhood sociology in Italy remains marginal in scientific research and university teaching. Its future depends partly on renewed political commitment to promoting children’s participation; however, its main obstacle is the lukewarm interest within the sociological community.",sociology

In this critical literature review of articles on disability and body size in the three highest ranking sociology generalist journals and two medical sociology journals over the past 10 years, we illustrate the main consequences when sociologists fail to employ a critical approach to the study of fat bodies and disabled bodyminds, including their use of eugenical logic and language.

This paper takes up the debate about the mechanisms of containment with reference to a neglected aspect—the process of ideology production itself. It is suggested that the symbolic structure of radical ideologies may be understood as the outcome of three conceptual processes: (1) de-legitimation; (2) dis-alienation; (3) `commutation' or communication/interaction. The ideological product may also be evaluated, in sociological terms, as a theoretical and empirical response to determinate social problems. Two recent examples are used to illustrate the main lines of such an analysis: the International Marxist Group in Britain, and Students for a Democratic Society in the USA. They indicate that the internal, conceptual requirements of a radical ideology, and especially the need to publicly present and validate ideological knowledge, may distort the social analysis in ways which render it less effective as a force for political mobilization, and therefore magnify the effects of more familiar structural constraints on radical movements.",sociology

We argue that with the passage of time, the academic field of deindustrialisation has matured as the scale and consequences of industrial loss become more apparent. We suggest here that sociology has not made the contribution it could have in this debate and that one of the key strengths of the area is its interdisciplinary nature; especially from disciplines such as geography, anthropology, and social history. Its key aim is to explain why this is the case and suggest that by fully engaging with the issue of deindustrialisation and the range of new material available, the sociology of economic life can develop a more rounded account both of work and its absence.",sociology

Arendt's theory of activity is initially reconstructed and defended as the basis for her criticism of the tendency of many sociological paradigms to conflate the activity of fabrication with that of action. Her critique of the explanatory assumptions underlying the concept of a `social process' is then applied to recent theorizing within historical sociology, with particular reference to the problematic assumptions surrounding the concept of sovereignty.",sociology

However any account of this must also look at the wider context of political and cultural constructions of childhood, children and young people, and intergenerational relationships in the UK. In the early stages of childhood studies there was a synchrony between the orientation of the new social studies of childhood in the UK and changes in how children came to be politically positioned, particularly with respect to an emphasis on children’s voices, their capacity to be agentic and their status as social actors. Since then the political status of childhood has become more problematic.

We find that the number of WRCs has increased in Argentina, and that they represent a viable production model. Further, they have generally maintained their central principles and even flourished. This occurred despite the global economic crisis, legal and financial pressures to adopt capitalist practices and management structures, the risk of market absorption and state attempts to coopt, demobilise and depoliticise the movement.

This paper explores the possibility of developing a sociological approach to love based upon the assumption that emotions are culturally constructed. Existing sociological and feminist work is suggestive of themes which the paper seeks to develop: the distinction commonly made between being `in love' and love as longer term affection, the mysterious power accorded to the former emotion, the contradictions between these two forms of love and the ways in which the ideology of romance has been associated with women's subordination. As a means of theorising these aspects of love, a conceptualisation of subjectivity as constituted through narrative or discourse is considered. This perspective may enable us to account for the cultural specificity of emotions, but there are questions which it leaves unanswered.",sociology

The introduction of this e-special discusses the increasing importance of gender in sociological analysis in the 1980s. This development is related to a shift from production to consumption and a growing interest in life-style leading to the debates around ‘the end of class’, the ‘cultural turn’ and ‘identity politics’. We assess the influence of articles published in the 1980s and how sociology – both the discipline and the journal – have changed since these articles have been published. The selected articles provide a historical perspective and are – as we argue – still highly relevant for the current state of the discipline and sociological debate. They illustrate the evolution of British sociology, from an emphasis on class analysis in the 1970s towards the growing prominence of intersectionality and subjectivity in the 1990s and beyond.

After reviewing the existing literature on the book, I discuss Mead’s most relevant contributions. In the proposal for a pragmatic sociology of the book that follows, I combine pragmatism’s focus upon the materiality of meaning-production with genealogy’s concern with power and violence.

Two actors participated in the animating discourse of caste and race in the annals of American sociology. Oliver Cromwell Cox took a class position to define caste, unmaking the hierarchies set in social structures. Instead, he advocated for a racialized system to understand the post-slavery capitalist America. Gerald Berreman represented a different camp that found social hierarchies to be co-determinant of relations and division arranged into a caste society. The debate over caste, nevertheless, admitted to the plausibility of castes contrasted with India’s caste system. However, caste categorization was found to be an appropriate application to the conditions of social inequalities. Gunnar Myrdal and other scholars of repute contributed to the debate. What remained limited in their theoretical contributions to the discussion was an inadequate focus on the lived reality and politics of the caste formulations in the postcolonial, socialist mode of production. A serious examination of untouchability, sub-castes and sub-sub-castes that regulate the kernel of the caste system as well as the racialized castes in India were not studied or referenced in detail.

What such an understanding fails to take into consideration, however, are the connections between Europe and the rest of the world that constitute the broader context for the emergence of what is understood to be the modern world and its institutions, such as the state and market. In this article, I suggest that integral to this misunderstanding, and its reproduction over time, is the methodology of comparative historical sociology as represented by ideal types.

In the present essay a reading of `mainstream' English Puritan writings on the calling is presented, and Weber's representation of the idea is found to be accurate except for an exaggeration of its asceticism, probably due to Weber's reliance on post-Civil War sources. The Puritan themes of chance, proof, and control are then shown to be prominent in Weber's usage of Chancen to define social action and institutions, and fundamental to the method of interpretive sociology. The rationalist biases of Weber's work, the problematic formal-substantive distinction, and Weber's justification of ideal-typical analysis are assessed in terms of the Puritan Berufsmensch who `neither inquires about nor finds it necessary to inquire about the meaning of his actual practice of a vocation within the whole world, the total framework of which is not his responsibility, but his God's'.",sociology

For this, I will theoretically survey the terms of sociality under the forces of immediate communication, ubiquitous surveillance, and the compression of time and space that Baudrillard and Virilio once problematized through the lens of critical technology theory to adapt it to media and communication studies. I contend that techno-aesthetics that converge with Rancière’s dissensus can provide practical suggestions on an updated vocation of critical sociology.

They indicate that the internal, conceptual requirements of a radical ideology, and especially the need to publicly present and validate ideological knowledge, may distort the social analysis in ways which render it less effective as a force for political mobilization, and therefore magnify the effects of more familiar structural constraints on radical movements.",sociology
10.1111/soc4.12143,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>This article reviews a range of new and established writing on deindustrialisation. It traces the origins of the concept from its popularisation in the early 1980s with the onset of large scale loss in the industrial regions of North America and Europe. We argue that with the passage of time, the academic field of deindustrialisation has matured as the scale and consequences of industrial loss become more apparent. We suggest here that sociology has not made the contribution it could have in this debate and that one of the key strengths of the area is its interdisciplinary nature; especially from disciplines such as geography, anthropology, and social history. Its key aim is to explain why this is the case and suggest that by fully engaging with the issue of deindustrialisation and the range of new material available, the sociology of economic life can develop a more rounded account both of work and its absence.",sociology
10.1177/1749975516639085,"Historical sociology can be understood both as a specific sub-field of sociology and as providing general conceptual underpinnings of the discipline, to the extent that it provides an understanding of the specificity of the modern state and the perceived emergence of modernity within Europe. The association of modernity with Europe (and with a European history limited to the self-identified boundaries of the continent) is commonplace and pervasive within the social sciences and humanities. What such an understanding fails to take into consideration, however, are the connections between Europe and the rest of the world that constitute the broader context for the emergence of what is understood to be the modern world and its institutions, such as the state and market. In this article, I suggest that integral to this misunderstanding, and its reproduction over time, is the methodology of comparative historical sociology as represented by ideal types. In contrast, I argue for ‘connected sociologies’ as a more appropriate way to understand our shared past and its continuing impact upon the present. I examine these issues in the context of historical sociological understandings of nation-state formation.",sociology

It also has links with the Chinese concept of face, which relates to the transfer of social science concepts from one cultural setting to another. By discussing the specificity and universality of face the article indicates the significance of the Chinese concept of face in a global sociology. The article goes on to examine aspects of the treatment of the Chinese concept of face and in doing so presents a more comprehensive account of a sociological conceptualization of face. The article then considers the relationship between face and emotions in indicating the mechanisms that underlie face.

In the 21st century, however, this condition hampers the adjustment to changes in family relations and in society at large. One implication is the ambiguous position of children, hanging between the private and the public domain, implying specific tensions and dilemmas. Two issues are significant: the division of responsibility for children between parents and collective institutions; and the search of parents and other educators — peers included — to find a balance between external social control and self-control in the formation of the personality of children. Dutch sociological research on children and childhood is scarce and fragmentary, which may be linked to the ambiguous social position of contemporary Dutch children.",sociology

In the 1990s, local administrations and national government promoted new opportunities for children’s participation in society, and sociologists began to analyse the various aspects of this participation. Since the 1990s, sociological research has included the legal and political bases of children’s citizenship and rights, forms of interaction promoting children’s participation, ways of including children in mainstream cultural tendencies, children’s observations of their social context, intercultural situations involving children, deviance and the labelling of children. The expansion of childhood sociology, however, has been slow, and the political impulse which supported children’s participation has partially evaporated. Childhood sociology in Italy remains marginal in scientific research and university teaching. Its future depends partly on renewed political commitment to promoting children’s participation; however, its main obstacle is the lukewarm interest within the sociological community.",sociology

The introduction of this e-special discusses the increasing importance of gender in sociological analysis in the 1980s. This development is related to a shift from production to consumption and a growing interest in life-style leading to the debates around ‘the end of class’, the ‘cultural turn’ and ‘identity politics’. We assess the influence of articles published in the 1980s and how sociology – both the discipline and the journal – have changed since these articles have been published. The selected articles provide a historical perspective and are – as we argue – still highly relevant for the current state of the discipline and sociological debate. They illustrate the evolution of British sociology, from an emphasis on class analysis in the 1970s towards the growing prominence of intersectionality and subjectivity in the 1990s and beyond. Feminist theory and research in the 1980s within and beyond Sociology indicate the importance and utility of intersectionality, even if the terminology has shifted, and the decade resulted in considerable advances in terms of the prominence, legitimacy and sophistication of gender analysis",sociology

I propose to remedy this situation by drawing upon the ideas of GH Mead, namely his neo-Hegelian theory of the subject–object relationship. Mead’s chief insight is that objects such as books are first social and only then physical entities. They have agency not because of their thing-ness, so to speak, but because of their sociality. After reviewing the existing literature on the book, I discuss Mead’s most relevant contributions. In the proposal for a pragmatic sociology of the book that follows, I combine pragmatism’s focus upon the materiality of meaning-production with genealogy’s concern with power and violence. I conclude with an illustration of the approach: the simultaneous decanonization of Tocqueville’s Democracy in America among sociologists today and its canonization in political science.",sociology

Arendt's theory of activity is initially reconstructed and defended as the basis for her criticism of the tendency of many sociological paradigms to conflate the activity of fabrication with that of action. Her critique of the explanatory assumptions underlying the concept of a `social process' is then applied to recent theorizing within historical sociology, with particular reference to the problematic assumptions surrounding the concept of sovereignty.",sociology

Specialist Spanish-language sources, survey data and documents are analysed through four key sociological themes. We find that the number of WRCs has increased in Argentina, and that they represent a viable production model. Further, they have generally maintained their central principles and even flourished. This occurred despite the global economic crisis, legal and financial pressures to adopt capitalist practices and management structures, the risk of market absorption and state attempts to coopt, demobilise and depoliticise the movement.

This paper explores the possibility of developing a sociological approach to love based upon the assumption that emotions are culturally constructed. Existing sociological and feminist work is suggestive of themes which the paper seeks to develop: the distinction commonly made between being `in love' and love as longer term affection, the mysterious power accorded to the former emotion, the contradictions between these two forms of love and the ways in which the ideology of romance has been associated with women's subordination. As a means of theorising these aspects of love, a conceptualisation of subjectivity as constituted through narrative or discourse is considered. This perspective may enable us to account for the cultural specificity of emotions, but there are questions which it leaves unanswered.",sociology

However any account of this must also look at the wider context of political and cultural constructions of childhood, children and young people, and intergenerational relationships in the UK. In the early stages of childhood studies there was a synchrony between the orientation of the new social studies of childhood in the UK and changes in how children came to be politically positioned, particularly with respect to an emphasis on children’s voices, their capacity to be agentic and their status as social actors. Since then the political status of childhood has become more problematic.

This represents something of a divergence between the orientations of UK policy and politics and contemporary orientations of the sociology of childhood.",sociology

Two actors participated in the animating discourse of caste and race in the annals of American sociology. Oliver Cromwell Cox took a class position to define caste, unmaking the hierarchies set in social structures. Instead, he advocated for a racialized system to understand the post-slavery capitalist America. Gerald Berreman represented a different camp that found social hierarchies to be co-determinant of relations and division arranged into a caste society. The debate over caste, nevertheless, admitted to the plausibility of castes contrasted with India’s caste system. However, caste categorization was found to be an appropriate application to the conditions of social inequalities. Gunnar Myrdal and other scholars of repute contributed to the debate. What remained limited in their theoretical contributions to the discussion was an inadequate focus on the lived reality and politics of the caste formulations in the postcolonial, socialist mode of production. A serious examination of untouchability, sub-castes and sub-sub-castes that regulate the kernel of the caste system as well as the racialized castes in India were not studied or referenced in detail.

First, by developing a broader concept of engaged social science that includes public sociology and policy or applied sociology, which solves specific social problems. Second, by suggesting ways to move toward greater engagement. Projects centered on creating new theory, the core work of professional sociology, can incorporate elements of engaged work. Policyoriented projects can grow to include the larger dialogues of public sociology. Third, by suggesting ways to manage tensions and create synergies between professional and engaged social science.

A review of the journal’s content from that era reveals a surprising dearth of work on the politics of group identity. In contrast, British sociology’s growing interest in questions of self, subjectivity, lifestyle and life course is well represented. Much of this work was developed in critical dialogue with the ‘individualization thesis’ that argued that people increasingly acted as choice-making individuals in control of their own lives. Through sophisticated use of theory, research and case studies many of the articles included in the e-special challenge the simplifications of this thesis. The selected articles are grouped in four sections: the first looks at attempts to theorize self-identity in late modernity; this is followed by three articles on consumerism and lifestyle; the next section contains articles on biography and the life course.

However, the Japanese image of ‘historical sociology’ is not that of a comparative history based on social scientific interests but is a history closer to cultural and social history and the history of ideas with an emphasis on descriptive research. This originates from the high degree of freedom given to the use of sources in the historical study of collective consciousness. Accordingly, it was easy to accept the impact of the linguistic turn. Subsequently, Japanese historical sociology evolved into discourse-historical research, media-historical research, and constructionist-historical research. In recent years, historical research on social issues and quantitative historical sociology have become increasingly popular.

Human nature is seen as a set of drives and capacities, which play a key role in people’s actions in any social context. In the textbooks, a variety of arguments suggest the irrelevance of a concept of human nature to the discipline. Partly, this message is conveyed by opposing social to biological explanations. In addition, the discipline is framed to exclude the concept of human nature. Society, on the one hand, and the culturally unique individual, on the other, exhaust the sociological arena. Accounts of socialization imply the transcendence of biology and with that, human nature. Refutations of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are supported with broad ranging rejections of biological explanation, with a similar implication that human nature is not a necessary concept in sociological accounts. Nevertheless, human nature is the elephant in the room. The concept is required and assumed in the detail of these textbooks as they explain current sociological research and analysis. One impact of the denial of human nature is to misunderstand current disputes between sociology and evolutionary psychology.",sociology

With increasing specialization in the field of knowledge in the course of the 20th century there was a neglect of social institutions in orthodox economic analysis and a parallel relative neglect of economic phenomena within sociological analysis. The latter condition has been exacerbated by the ‘cultural turn’ in social thought that took place towards the close of the century, ironically a period marked by the growing prominence of economic matters in social and political life. This paper presents an argument for a return to the analytic concern with economic life that lies at the heart of classical sociology, for an ‘economic turn’ in contemporary sociological thought. This is achieved through a discussion of the work of J.K. Galbraith on economics and the transformation of capitalism; private affluence and public provision; and the consequences of a culture of contentment, work that suggests an affinity with the analytic preoccupations of the classical sociologists.

Influenced by five exceptionally learned and lucid sociologists – John Rex, Herminio Martins, Raymond Williams, Pierre Bourdieu and Terry Lovell – she has spent her sociological career contributing to the demystification of power in various forms. In particular she has focused on the significance of secular culture – notably literature – in creating hegemonic domination. She has also analysed the role of symbolic revolutions in social transformation, avoiding in this respect falling either into idealism or simplistic class reductionism. Arguing that sociological theory still needs to teach Marx, Weber and Durkheim, these founding figures should not be seen as creating – in social scientific terms – a unified architectural construction, but should be read with and against one another; further, they need also to be combined with other, more contemporary, influences.

Such debates around conceptualization naturally led to disagreements over the manner in which authority should be measured (qualitative categories versus quantitative scales) for empirical assessment of social inequality. Thus, this field of sociological inquiry is about measuring positions in the workplace, the processes leading to those positions, and the consequences of those positions for workplace rewards. In addition to theory and measurement, the emergence of authority research includes studies of gender, race, and ethnic differences in the factors that determine authority and in the consequences of authority for various workplace outcomes. As multiracial/ethnic samples became available, researchers focused on the manner in which gender intersected with race/ethnicity to forge differential authority outcomes for men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Studies here underscore the fact that job authority remains unevenly distributed nationally (race/ethnicity, gender), and cross-nationally (gender), and authority gaps have remained robust over time. Authority studies employ a variety of data from the United States and Europe, regions that dominate quantitative assessments of authority inequality, but recent data from Israel and Korea foreshadow the extension of these inquiries to less traditional locales, thereby expanding our understanding of group differences and similarities in authority attainment more globally.</p>",sociology

Contributions from the field include theoretical frameworks to address how children and youth learn about race and racism, form racial identities and racial attitudes, and understand themselves and others as racial subjects. Additionally, sociological research offers a wealth of empirical evidence concerning how children and youth experience, navigate, reinforce, and/or challenge racial inequality, racism, and racial discrimination in their everyday lives. This work examines the role that social structures, systems, and institutions—such as families, schools, the state, health-care systems, the economic system, and the media—play in shaping young people’s lived experiences, opportunities, and outcomes. Sociological research also explores the process of the racialization of youth, the consequences of these racialized understandings, and how this leads to the continued dehumanization of children of color. Scholarship additionally examines the agency of young people and how they engage as political participants in the racialized society in which they live as well as how youth participate in consumer culture in ways that connect to their own racial and ethnic identities. Sociologists in the current moment tend to pay particular attention to the establishment of child-centered methodologies and strategies for equitable and ethical approaches to the study of youth and race. As such, many of these citations highlight scholarly efforts to dismantle long-standing racist stereotypes and assumptions about young people of color and demonstrate the complex nature of race, racism, and racialization with respect to youth.</p>",sociology

The study of race in the social sciences is an established, dynamic, multidisciplinary, and international field. Work began at the end of the 19th century. To study race with a global perspective, it is necessary to have a transdisciplinary view to read critically the phenomena that intersect with this variable. This field includes contributions from sociology, history, philosophy, legal studies, anthropology, cultural studies, political science, epidemiology, and journalism, among others. Several declarations have been made in recent years about the alleged end of racism or the end of a race-coded era. However, even though they are not new, every time they resurge these doxas underline new regimes of truth, reconfigure racisms, and strength inequality. The vast literature produced by scholars in this field provides evidence of how race is based on narratives created to enslave, subordinate, exploit, and exclude millions of human beings across the globe.</p>",sociology

The interdisciplinary nature of this topic has resulted in scholarship on many different aspects of the body across the life course. The works included here are foundational to knowledge about the gendered body and particularly the sociology of the body. Moreover, they exhibit intersectionality and begin with the assumption that social constructs such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, age, and dis/ability intersect with gender to shape life experiences, social outcomes, and self-concept. While there are many areas that fall under the topic of gender and bodies (such as medicalization, sport, disability, gendered violence, sexual practices, and eating disorders) this article focuses particularly on theory and research on the social construction of female and male bodies, as well as bodies that disrupt sex, gender, and sexuality binaries, i.e., intersex and LGBTQ Bodies. Specifically, there is an abundance of scholarship that examines how social and cultural structures patrol normative femininities and hegemonic masculinities thereby reinforcing binary understandings of sex and gender. Nonetheless, there is some work that emphasizes the undoing of gender, social activism, and embodied resistance. Writings on gendered constructs and the body also examine how some bodies are privileged over others, showing a body hierarchy based on, for example, beauty, skin tone, and body size that furnishes some people with physical capital while disadvantaging others. Finally, the article acknowledges research and theory that engages labor-related processes about the body; the body as a modification project (including body building, tattooing, and Cosmetic Surgery); and the role of medical and other technologies on gendered bodies and lives.</p>",sociology

The differences Bourdieu identifies as signifying classes do so only as arbitrary signs and not because of any intrinsic qualities. Furthermore, it is argued that this relational logic is a necessary completion in Bourdieu’s analysis, because of his rejection of Kantian aesthetics, in which an immediate understanding of intrinsic quality is a central point. Both the Kantian and the Saussurean influence are given in the title and subtitle of his work: Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.

Nevertheless, internal differentiations continue to make of this `continent' one of the most complex and variegated culture areas in the world. Three dimensions are of particular relevance in this regard: (a) the level of socio-economic development; (b) linguistic-cultural and religious traditions; (c) the type of political system. If we allocate 25 of the larger European nation-states to this 3-dimensional typology, we can demonstrate a limited number of relatively internally homogeneous clusters of nations. These are distinguished from each other not only in terms of political system, but also in terms of socio-economic development, language and religion.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0223,"<p>The term “professions” generally refers to occupations that require expertise obtainable only through specialized training and credentialed by advanced degrees or licenses. Examples include academia, medicine, law, engineering, the clergy, and accountancy. The professions generally provide greater social prestige relative to other occupations. Moreover, professionals determine the scope of their work, the requisite level of expertise, and the terms of inclusion. Much of the research on gender and professions highlights the structural barriers to entry and advancement by women. Because the professions developed from endeavors long considered “gentlemanly vocations,” they were historically dominated by men. Most universities prohibited women from matriculating until the mid-1800s, allowing few to obtain the advanced education required for the professions. By excluding women from highly rewarded roles, the professions have long produced and maintained gender inequalities, particularly the Wage Gap. Over recent decades, women have entered the professions in growing numbers. In some cases, such as veterinary medicine, women have even overtaken men numerically, resulting in the feminization of the field. Salaries in feminized professions, or sectors of a profession, are generally lower than are those in fields with fewer women. The explanations offered for this wage gap involve devaluation or queuing. The devaluation view argues that the sex composition of a profession affects the salary offered. Because of gender bias, employers devalue work done by women. Consequently, they lower the rewards in occupations numerically dominated by women. This is particularly the case for professions involving emotional labor and care work. In the queuing view, the salary levels of a profession affect its gender composition. Although both men and women prefer to work in higher paid professions, employers prefer to hire men for high-reward positions. This suggests a gendered labor queue consisting of men, leaving women clustered in professions offering lower pay. In research on other topics, different definitions of “gender” lead to varying perspectives on its implications for the professions. When understood as a set of attributes associated with biological sex, research emphasizes the sex-typing of skills and sex-based differences within professions. When understood as a relation that influences interactions and identities, research investigates how gender informs the daily functioning of the workplace in various ways, producing professional cultures that create formal or informal barriers and advantages.</p>",sociology

This body of scholarship documents both similarity and difference between the health experience of men and women across the life course. Gender-based health patterns are dependent upon the health outcome examined, as life expectancy is shorter among men while women experience higher rates of various non-fatal functional problems and chronic medical conditions. Gender differences also exist in mental health outcomes and participation in various healthy and unhealthy behaviors, including utilization of health care services. Yet these associations are not uniform and can differ when various population subgroups are compared. As such, a growing body of scientific work argues for the need to apply an intersectional lens to the study of gender and health, and this work details how various cross-cutting identities (e.g., age, racial/ethnicity identity, social class, sexual orientation) intersect with gender to shape health outcomes. More recently, scholars have begun to assess how non-binary measures of gender identity relate to health status, and thus a small but increasing body of research explores whether and how health status varies for cisgender and transgender adults. While a substantial amount of attention has been given to describing the nuances of how gender relates to health status, the gender-health literature is also characterized by robust discussion of the factors that contribute to gender patterns in health status, including but not limited to socioeconomic status, relationships and care work, differential experiences in medical care treatment, masculinity, stress and social supports, and health behaviors.

Therefore, she needs a fiduciary to carry out that action, who does not necessarily have an interest in carrying it out to the satisfaction of the beneficiary. Since this is a problematic and potentially dangerous relationship for the beneficiary, both in private law and in democratic political relations, the fiduciary must be held accountable. That is why contemporary economics, law, bioethics and political philosophy have dealt with fiduciary relationships. In contrast, the fiduciary approach has been rare in the field of economics and society. A reflection on the interest of incorporating fiduciary analysis (in its empirical and normative dimensions) is proposed, illustrating it with the case of property.

By modifying Donald Noel's theory of ethnic stratification, Nibert explains the oppression of non‐human animals in all forms, from meat eating to vivisection. He then argues that the systematic oppression of animals led to the oppression of other humans.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Online materials</jats:title> <jats:bold>Animals and Society Section of the American Sociological Association</jats:bold>  <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""http://www2.asanet.org/sectionanimals/"">http://www2.asanet.org/sectionanimals/</jats:ext-link> This website offers membership information specifically for sociologists interested in human–animal studies.

This can involve an individual animal, a group of animals, or an entire species.

You must have two entries per week. These need not be long; one page for each entry will suffice. However, they must demonstrate that you are thinking about the issues we are studying. The entries are to be analysis, not cute stories of how much you love animals. You must apply the material to your thoughts about and/or your interaction with animals.

<jats:disp-quote content-type=""quotation""> <jats:italic>Example</jats:italic>: Farm animals have such a huge role in so many institutions. So much of the economy has to do with raising animals, transporting animals, killing them, processing their skin, muscle, organs, coats, and bones. It makes sense that we have commercials promoting ‘Beef, it's what's for dinner’ and ‘Got Milk’ ads. If it were ‘natural’ and necessary to consume animals, we would not need advertising campaigns designed to encourage us to do so. The ‘animal industrial complex’ depends on a steady supply of consumers. Vegetarians and vegans are very threatening to the status quo. No wonder popular culture makes fun of them.Farm animals also have a huge role in families. We eat animals on most of our holidays and other occasions. In addition, the histories of agricultural families go back ...</jats:disp-quote>

10.1111/1468-4446.12077,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>This article introduces the idea of philosophical sociology as an enquiry into the relationships between implicit notions of human nature and explicit conceptualizations of social life within sociology. Philosophical sociology is also an invitation to reflect on the role of the normative in social life by looking at it sociologically and philosophically at the same: <jats:italic>normative</jats:italic> self‐reflection is a fundamental aspect of sociology's <jats:italic>scientific</jats:italic> tasks because key sociological questions are, in the last instance, also philosophical ones. For the normative to emerge, we need to move away from the reductionism of hedonistic, essentialist or cynical conceptions of human nature and be able to grasp the conceptions of the good life, justice, democracy or freedom whose normative contents depend on more or less articulated conceptions of our shared humanity. The idea of philosophical sociology is then sustained on three main pillars and I use them to structure this article: (1) a revalorization of the relationships between sociology and philosophy; (2) a universalistic principle of humanity that works as a major regulative idea of sociological research, and; (3) an argument on the social (immanent) and pre‐social (transcendental) sources of the normative in social life. As invitations to embrace posthuman cyborgs, non‐human actants and material cultures proliferate, philosophical sociology offers the reminder that we still have to understand more fully who are the human beings that populate the social world.",sociology
10.1177/14687950122232530,"The cause of German anti-Semitism should not be sought at the level of individual attitudes but, firstly, in the context of German history and social development, and, secondly, in the changing social position of the Jews within that setting. During the Middle Ages, when the estates and guild-orders prevailed, there were severe tensions between Christians and Jews. These began to be moderated with the development of capitalism, as members of the Christian middle class became involved in a struggle to end traditional restrictions. In that context, independently of their attitudes towards them, emancipation of the Jews appeared to middle-class Christians as a precondition for the emergence of Jews as good German citizens, and Jewish merchants and bankers became welcome allies in economic expansion. However, once the struggle of the middle classes against the nobility had been won, the Christian sections of the newly dominant ruling class underwent a political u-turn; hostility against the Jews, who had become a middle class of second rank, increased. It increased still further with the loss of the First World War and the crises that followed it, especially among the most economically constricted strata. In that situation, the Jews were socially conspicuous but relatively powerless. They had few resources for struggling effectively against what had become, for them, a crippling social order. Better to fight for a home in Palestine, or at least to accustom themselves to behaving in a self-aware but unobtrusive way. [Translators' text.]",sociology
10.1177/1440783312458226,"Sociology once debated ‘the social’ and did so with a public readership. Even as late as the Second World War, sociologists commanded a wide public on questions about the nature of society, altruism and the direction of social evolution. As a result of several waves of professionalization, however, these issues have vanished from academic sociology and from the public writings of sociologists. From the 1960s onwards sociologists instead wrote for the public by supporting social movements. Discussion within sociology became constrained both by ‘professional’ expectations and political taboos. Yet the original motivating concerns of sociology and its public, such as the compatibility of socialism and Darwinism, the nature of society, and the process of social evolution, did not cease to be of public interest. With sociologists showing little interest in satisfying the demand, it was met by non-sociologists, with the result that sociology lost both its intellectual public, as distinct from affinity groups, and its claim on these topics.",sociology

I ask six questions that help us as sociologists to think about how introductory sociology can better serve our discipline, our students, and their communities. These questions ask us to consider who our students are, how the course fits with university mission and program goals, what we want students to learn in this course and how we can build consensus about that common core, the extent to which there is alignment between learning objectives and our disciplinary standards in sociology, how assessment can be used to improve course design and curriculum in general, and the role that introductory sociology plays in recruitment and retention of students to the university and to the major. Posing such questions will promote further discussion and consensus building among sociology colleagues with the aim of improving curriculum and student learning.",sociology

10.1332/policypress/9781529211740.003.0002,"<p>A unifying theme in the chapters in this volume is that semiotics offers important analytic tools for understanding the creation and reproduction of contextual meaning in social life (see Introduction). Consistent with this theme, my research program has centered on the semiotic distinction between the socially marked and the socially unmarked. I have employed these sensitizing analytic concepts to examine a range of issues, including sexual identity (Brekhus, 1996), theoretical attention in sociology (Brekhus, 1998, 2000), cognition (Brekhus, 2015; Brekhus and Ignatow, 2019), risk (Brekhus, 2018), and identity (Brekhus, 2020). Broadly speaking, I focus on identity, difference, cognition, and representation, with a particular interest in the ways that intersecting dimensions of markedness and unmarkedness shape cultural perception, worldviews, cognition, and the reproduction of social inequalities. The semiotic distinction between the marked and the unmarked was first introduced in the 1930s by linguists Trubetzkoy and Jakobson (see Jakobson, 1972; Trubetzkoy and Jakobson, 1975: 162). Linguist Linda Waugh (1982), in her article “Marked and Unmarked: A Choice between Unequals in Semiotic Structure,” developed the marked/unmarked distinction into a broader semiotic framework featuring semiotic pairs such as blackness/whiteness and homosexuality/heterosexuality, across different semiotic systems (see also Zerubavel, 2018, p. 2). Following the lead of Waugh, who argued that the same logic of the actively accented (marked) and the passively unacknowledged (unmarked) that applied to linguistic contrasts also applies to social contrasts, I have helped to import these concepts into the social sciences. In my own work, inspired by Waugh’s analysis, I first applied a semiotic markedness/unmarkedness analysis to sexual identity construction in the US (Brekhus, 1996), wherein I noted that some sexual behaviors and identities are marked as “deviant” and given special labels, while others remain unmarked, unaccented, and even unlabeled.</p>",sociology

Yet not all scholars were happy with the notion of globalization. Some claim that is merely a new name for earlier theories and concepts. Among those who reject new paradigmatic thinking on the current age is Immanuel Wallerstein, the world-renowned sociologist and ‘father’ of the world-system paradigm. This article is intended as an appraisal of Wallerstein’s œuvre in the context of the debate on global transformations in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and from the vantage point of the present author’s own critical globalization perspective. The first three parts summarize and assess Wallerstein’s theoretical system and his many contributions to macro, historical and comparative sociology, to development studies and international political economy. The fourth discusses Wallerstein’s assessment of the evolution of the world capitalist system in recent decades, including his views on the concept of globalization, and the fifth focuses on earlier and more recent critical appraisals of his work, including the present author’s own, in light of the recent transformations in world capitalism identified with globalization.",sociology
10.1177/0038038504039364,"In contemporary Western societies, shyness appears to be an increasingly common experience, and yet its sociological relevance has been overlooked. Within psychology, the condition has been seen as an individual pathology, and there has been little attempt to relate this to the wider cultural context. The argument of this article is that shyness can be interpreted as both a privately felt state of mind and a publicly recognized social role. I revisit Mead’s conception of the self as an inner conversation between the ‘I’ and the ‘Me’, arguing that the shy actor perceives themselves as relatively unskilled in interaction by comparison to a ‘Competent Other’. It is then suggested that it is normal for people to drift into isolated episodes of shyness as primary deviance, but that in some cases the reactions of others can lead to a career of secondary deviance. However, while a display of shyness may be normalized in certain situations, in others it can pose a more serious or enduring threat to the residual rules of interaction.This motivates the non-shy majority to defend their normative assumptions by casting moral blame upon the individual, and reframes the ‘problem’ outside of society.",sociology

The book analyses the social implications and prospects of the digitalisation. The objectivity of this process leading to the complication of society, its dehumanisation and the emergence of new previously unseen risks, is noted. Scientific and technological innovations reduce the share of traditional risks, natural and technological, but increase the share of institutional risks. Sergey A. Kravchenko calls this new reality the socio-digital-natural reality, in which, primarily in social networks, both human actors and non-human (digital) actors, sociotechnical and techno-social hybrids operate. The author of the book being reviewed concludes that there is a need for a humanistic digital turn, a change in approaches and focus of modern scientific knowledge, which should be integrated and multidisciplinary, based on the social and natural sciences integration, aimed at the analysis of disequilibrium systems in which disequilibrium, turbulence do not exclude the tendencies towards organisation and self-organisation.The peer-reviewed work is an educational publication and it is aimed at developing students’ ability to think critically about the consequences of digitalisation and make balanced managerial decisions.

At the crux of this model is a site, the supermarket, that dramatizes nonhuman agency as a mundane yet complex fact of social experience—a fact that Latour theorizes throughout his writings and that a host of literary authors, above all Don DeLillo, have sought to explore in different ways. It offers a reading of the novel in terms of Actor-Network-Theory (ANT) and demonstrates how a site that is crucial to both the novelist and the sociologist can facilitate a new interdisciplinary conversation, a mode of inquiry that would divert from a more traditional sociology of literature whose objective would be to identify the deep significance of literary form in the social forces that subtend aesthetic production.</p>",sociology

Educational policies include those official and unofficial guidelines that are developed by policymakers, school administrators, and educators to influence the way that schools both directly and indirectly provide education to students. In the United States, these policies include a variety of state and federal laws and regulations that govern students’ pre-kindergarten, primary (K–8), and secondary schooling (high school), as well as policies affecting higher education (college and beyond). Scholars studying education show that examining how policies are created—who creates it and for what purpose—and also how the policy is put into practice at the state and district level is crucial for understanding inequalities. This entry focuses on K–12 educational policy and race in the United States. More specifically, the focus is primarily on influential policies in schools since the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision, with particular attention on two crucial types of race-based educational policy: desegregation and school choice programs. There are many other educational policies not addressed here that could be examined for their influence in racial schooling inequities. This piece focuses on K–12 educational policies, but policies related to race in pre-K as well as institutions of higher education are also areas in which educational policies are impacted by race relations. Examining those formal and informal guidelines for the way that they shape children’s schooling is crucial for understanding how racial inequalities persist within contemporary society. As a practice of power, education policy has the potential to be used as a tool for positive social change and disrupt white supremacy within the context of schooling. Yet doing so requires first recognizing the way that race and racism have been written into school policies.</p>",sociology

In particular, scholars have called for a greater emphasis on incorporating race as a category of analysis within the organizations and movement literatures. Among those studying organizations, one of the earliest calls for this shift came from within the managerial literature. Those heeding this call have primarily investigated race as an individual level characteristic that structures people’s access to and opportunities within organizations. Still, others have sought to analyze how race as a social structural characteristic shapes organizational development and the distribution of resources available to organizations. Similar to organization studies, initially, scholarship on social movements lacked a clear emphasis on race. Although, the irony here is that many scholars derived theoretical innovations within the social movement literature by analyzing movements centering racial justice. Recent scholarship holds that in the absence of clear racial theory, whiteness shapes the discipline to its detriment. Despite the broader concerns about the literature’s state, work within this area consistently emphasizes how people use social movement tactics to advance racial projects from civil rights to white supremacy. Few studies tackle all three themes at once. More often scholars situate their analysis at the intersection of race and organizations or race and movements. At times, scholars situate their investigation squarely within one literature, leaving it to the reader to pull out the themes from the others. The bibliography reflects this reality and tension. There is no singular text or handbook that brings together research on race, organizations, and movements. Yet, the research included within this bibliography deepens our understanding of the role that organizations and movements play in reinforcing and creating racial hierarchy and how racial hierarchy, in turn, shapes these entities.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0216,"<p>Ethnomethodology (literally people’s methodology) is the study of practices through which members of a society collectively organize and sustain their activities. As the term suggests, ethnomethodology treats methodology as a widespread social phenomenon in addition to being a specialized set of practices in a science or other professional undertaking. Consequently, for ethnomethodology, the development and practical use of methods is a topic of sociological investigation rather than an exclusive disciplinary resource. Harold Garfinkel (b. 1917–d. 2011) coined the term “ethnomethodology” and founded the field that goes by that name. He studied under Talcott Parsons (b. 1902–d. 1979), but radically transformed the structural-functionalist theory of action that Parsons developed in the 1930s and 1940s. Garfinkel’s distinctive empirical approach to social action and interaction drew upon Edmund Husserl’s (b. 1859–d. 1938) phenomenological analysis of the everyday life-world, which Alfred Schutz (b. 1899–d. 1959) developed for sociology. Garfinkel gave relatively little mention of the philosophy of ordinary language arising from the later philosophical work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (b. 1889–d. 1951), and developed in reference to the social sciences by Peter Winch (b. 1926–d. 1997), but others have drawn linkages between them. Ethnomethodological research describes the organization of situated activities, including commonsense reasoning and ordinary language use, as well as more specialized practices of playing music, solving mathematics problems, or performing scientific experiments. Although ethnomethodology initially developed as part of sociology, and is still recognized as a sociological subfield, it has made inroads into philosophy of social science, social anthropology, communication and information studies, education studies, and science and technology studies. The allied field of Conversation Analysis, founded by Harvey Sacks (1935–1975) and developed by his students and colleagues, has also made strong inroads into sociolinguistics and related areas of research on social interaction.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0269,"<p>Consumer debt refers to (1) household (as opposed to corporate or sovereign) debt that is (2) acquired with the purpose of purchasing consumer goods or services (as opposed to, for instance, micro-credit for business purposes) and (3) owed towards financial institutions and retail entities (as opposed to, for instance, family members, the state, or universities) (4) through a credit contract (as opposed to unpaid bills or overdue rent). In the legal sense, consumer credit only refers to unsecured debt (e.g., payday loans, credit card debt, car purchase loans, consumer loans); however, in the sociological literature, it is used more broadly to include also secured debt, such as home equity loans and mortgages. The social studies of consumer credit and debt draw on economic sociology, economic geography, political economy, organization theory, cultural sociology, and economic anthropology to examine the social, political, and cultural causes and consequences of indebtedness. The wider theoretical concern of this inquiry is not debt per se, but to understand how debt changes our answers to long-standing sociological questions relating to inequality, social relations, cultural change, power, and the connections between economy and society. This review starts with general-scope sociological (General Overviews) and social history (Social History of Credit and Debt) studies on debt, which explicate the broader sociological and cultural significance of widespread indebtedness. The review then covers the two main strands of the social study of credit and debt. The first focuses on the institutional causes of indebtedness, examining macropolitical and cultural shifts (Debt and Cultural Theory), economic policy and institutional differences across countries (Political Economy of Credit and Debt), meso-level, institutional processes (Making of Credit Markets: Institutions and Fields), and the development of credit products and credit scoring within financial institutions (Inside Financial Institutions: Banks and the Lending Process). The second angle focuses on borrowers, looking at the consequences of indebtedness on social inequalities (Credit, Debt, and Inequality); at the credit process—how households borrow, how it changes their everyday life, how they are affected by payment difficulties—unpacking the way debt impacts subjectivities, social relationships, and oppression through lived experiences (Borrowers and the Credit Process); and at opportunities for resistance (Debt Resistance, Financial Dissent, and the New Politics of Finance). This review does not include student debt and microfinance because they are technically not consumer credit; nor does it include mortgage-backed securities, which are not credit products in themselves, but credit derivatives.</p>",sociology

To orient this enterprise, this article examines the concepts of creativity and novelty in social theory and explains why it is challenging work to broker concepts across intellectual communities. To understand the existing boundaries across which one could broker, it next describes how the subfield of economic sociology has been shaped by the separation of economics and sociology as distinct fields, which ultimately led to a decline of sociologists studying the economy. Two counter-acting organizational forces that sought to institutionalize a subfield of economic sociology was the formation in the mid-1970s of the International Sociological Association’s Research Committee on Economy and Society (ISA RC02), and the institutionalization in the mid-1980s of the New Economic Sociology. The latter became a global brand exported from the United States that eclipsed the former. The New Economic Sociology, a community of scholars primarily based in and focused on the United States and typically indifferent (if not skeptical) to neo-Marxist approaches and international political economy, became globally associated with what constitutes economic sociology (and what is not). Consequently, it would be beneficial to broker in concepts to economic sociology beyond the historic limitations of the New Economic Sociology.",sociology

Intensive sociological research on children has had a relatively short history, but in that time it has become an important contribution to the analysis of society. It has the capacity to serve as an x-ray or a magnifying glass, or just to provide an additional perspective in analysing social processes. It is clear from all the reports that sociological research and its social background are interdependent. Although childhood sociology has always been internationally oriented, there is a variety of themes and approaches and different emphases placed on particular topics in the different countries. Such differences can be traced back to the social definitions of childhood characterizing the respective societies. For almost all of the countries, however, there is only a weak connection between sociological research concerning children and the core domains of sociology.

Peirce also created the modern theory of the dialogical self, which explained the symbolic character of human beings and proved foundational for social psychology. Politically Peirce was a right-wing conservative, but his ideas eventually contributed to the egalitarian views of cultures and sub-cultures. In addition his ideas contributed, by way of unanticipated consequences, to the 20th-century human rights revolutions in the American legal system.

First, the concept of reconciliation is interrogated as an instrument for sociological enquiry. The article locates the concept’s lexical origins in western/northern Christian traditions and identifies the usages of religious connotations in secularised strands of conflict resolution theory and praxis. While acknowledging the problems involved in assuming a conceptual universality, the basic meaning of the concept is located in many different historical, religious and secular traditions across the globe. Once overcoming Christiano-centric and western/northern biases and limitations, reconciliation can be retrieved and operationalised as a sociological concept for understanding and comparing ethnically and other deeply divided societies. Second, the article argues for further development of sociological comparative perspectives on how societies deal with violent and divisive past, which enhances academic knowledge and may impact policy as regards reconciliation processes, both in terms of understanding the past as well as dealing with the present and future of post-conflict societies. A sociology of conflict and reconciliation offers frames for transferring knowledge and experience that transcends simplistic assumptions and enriches understanding of the complexities of conflict and its transformations.",sociology

Within the framework of a ‘return to the actor’, marked by interpretative theories and symbolic interactionism, some sociologists of education played an important part in this rediscovery, paying attention to ‘pupilhood’ ( métier d’élève), and then to the métier d’enfant. The new status of the child in modernity was thus scrutinized within the framework of theories of individualism. The main research trends are: a reflexive view of expert discourses, the child as a social actor, social policies and childhood and children’s culture. From the ‘king child’ to the ‘child as a victim’, the political, juridical and media scene is constantly fuelled by a number of heated debates about the new figures of childhood, the child of desire, the child as problem, the child at risk, or the dangerous child.

It also reflects the influence of the Marxist tradition in Australia, focusing mainly on the state as a countervailing force to markets. The upshot is that the market is both a constant point of reference in sociological research, but also a ‘black box’ beyond social inquiry.

Sociologists are increasingly conceptualizing poverty, global economic inequality, and social inequalities of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation not as social problems, but rather as human rights abuses. The shift of emphasis from the social problems perspective to the human rights perspective demands a different set of remedies from IGOs, national governments, and local authorities. Whereas in the past sociologists tended either to recommend modifications to social policies or to propose large‐scale social transformation, they now find themselves advocating the implementation of human rights on the global, national, and local levels. This has brought sociologists into the area of global governance. The process of delineating an explicitly sociological perspective on human rights is impeded by two overlapping dilemmas: (1) the tension between an approach that emphasizes the analysis of ‘rights effects’ on the global, national, and local levels and an approach that stresses the advocacy of rights as a palliative for social inequalities; and (2) the tension between an interdisciplinary vision, in which sociology would join other disciplines in illuminating human rights and a unidisciplinary vision, in which sociologists and their allies would push for a unified social science founded on human rights.",sociology

The study is based on the conceptual scheme proposed by Burawoy, highlighting four different disciplinary practices: ‘professional sociology’, ‘policy sociology’, ‘critical sociology’ and ‘public sociology’. The formation of a ‘global sociology’ demands harmonious development and mutual enrichment between all the four ‘sociologies’, however, each of them has its own path in the global arena. The literature analysis demonstrates serious limitations in the global progression of ‘professional sociology’, while ‘policy sociology’ and ‘critical sociology’ also experience major difficulties. ‘Public sociology’, largely inspired by Burawoy, seems to be especially promising globally due to its key advantages: orientation towards non-academic audiences and a focus on the most acute social problems. However, currently this disciplinary practice has several fundamental constraints: marginality, radicalism, ideological bias and inherent conflict-orientation towards other ‘sociologies’. Drawing on John Meyer’s theory of ‘Scientized Environment Supporting Actorhood’, the article proposes the project of the new ‘Global Solidarity Sociology’, which utilizes the advantages of Michael Burawoy’s project while overcoming its principal limitations.",sociology

Abortion is also commonly politicised and presented in public discourse as inherently contentious or controversial. However, recent sociological research on women's experiences of abortion is relatively thin on the ground. The body of qualitative research on abortion experiences, which does exist, varies in scope and focus on a relatively limited range of themes. Building on an earlier review of qualitative research on women's abortion experiences, this paper explores the recent literature and identifies three key thematic areas: the context of abortion; reasons and decision‐making; and abortion stigma. It then goes on to identify gaps in the literature, to explore what shape a sociology of women's abortion experiences might take and to suggest future directions for sociological research.",sociology

Beginning in the published work of 1896, there emerges a much more subjectivist theory still Durkheim calls this his 'religious sociology' With it, he felt, he could finally present the alternative to matenalism he had always sought, and through it he argued with his critics that he had never been 'materialist' at all!

Contradictory paradigms and lack of academic reputation marked the beginnings of German sociology. After World War I it had to defend itself against right-wing political mistrust. Therefore, many sociologists abstained from political comment and from empirical research as well. Beginning in 1925 there arose a new empirical orientation whose proponents were mostly on the right. Even for them, the take-over of the Nazis came as a total surprise. Jewish sociologists were forced to emigrate, leaving most others to accommodate to the new situation. Empirical social research flourished in the service of different political aims, while, with few exceptions, sociological theory disappeared or became insipid.

Yet ecology specifies that natural and social entities are bound together in complex interrelations. Why then does sociology insist on sifting out the social from the natural? The paper takes this question as its starting point and seeks to identify what environmental sociology might gain and lose from a shift towards ecological thinking. It does so by examining the case of actor-network theory, an approach that, in significant respects, closely approximates a kind of `ecological sociology'. Actor-network theory is `co-constructionist': it seeks to identify how relations and entities come into being together. Critics have focused on the problems of co-constructionism: they have argued that human actors generally possess powers of reflection (through language) and that these powers of reflection provide motive forces for action. Thus some form of social analysis is still necessary. Any ecological sociology will thus need to bring these two perspectives together so that humans and non-humans can be considered within the same frame of reference but so the distinctions that generally hold between the two can also be assessed.",sociology

This is because these books make the modern experience of European empires, colonialism, and, in many instances, incomplete decolonization central to sociology. They also question the discipline’s origin narratives and these narratives’ implications in colonial modernity. Thus, the books hold up a mirror reflecting back onto the discipline of sociology its own implication in European empires and colonization and demonstrate how sociology’s imperial episteme continues to shape the discipline today. This article reviews these books and focuses on how they engage in the double task of the deconstruction of sociology’s complicity in empire and the construction of a colonial critique-centered sociology.

The contrast is therefore between a well-known sociologist, one of the foremost scholars in economic sociology in the English language, and an economist of international renown who has challenged mainstream economics with his research on economic inequality and his call for participatory public involvement in economic decision-making. Both insist on the economic as social, but in distinctive ways. In this essay, first, I consider Granovetter’s long-awaited Society and Economy: Framework and Principles and Piketty’s recent Capital et idé ologie, a follow-up to his earlier, best-selling book, on their own terms. Second, I think through how each scholar might understand and critique the other, pointing to complementarities and important differences in their approaches. I conclude that although both Granovetter and Piketty challenge mainstream economistic accounts of economic life, while emphasizing human agency and so the contingency of given economic relationships, they differ significantly in their respective analytical and political-normative focus. For Granovetter, what matters is that economic life is a social fact, while for Piketty it is a social struggle.",sociology

Such an analysis of continuities and ruptures shows the theoretical convergences among Latin America as a region and the political dynamics of specific historical processes. I highlight how the conceptions of 21st-century Ecuadorian populism as a “passive revolution” or “authoritarian disfigurement of democracy” provide some theoretical tools for examining the historical process of Ecuadorian populism but ultimately fall short of critical analysis.

Sociologists are increasingly conceptualizing poverty, global economic inequality, and social inequalities of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation not as social problems, but rather as human rights abuses. The shift of emphasis from the social problems perspective to the human rights perspective demands a different set of remedies from IGOs, national governments, and local authorities. Whereas in the past sociologists tended either to recommend modifications to social policies or to propose large‐scale social transformation, they now find themselves advocating the implementation of human rights on the global, national, and local levels. This has brought sociologists into the area of global governance. The process of delineating an explicitly sociological perspective on human rights is impeded by two overlapping dilemmas: (1) the tension between an approach that emphasizes the analysis of ‘rights effects’ on the global, national, and local levels and an approach that stresses the advocacy of rights as a palliative for social inequalities; and (2) the tension between an interdisciplinary vision, in which sociology would join other disciplines in illuminating human rights and a unidisciplinary vision, in which sociologists and their allies would push for a unified social science founded on human rights.",sociology

This article puts forward a sociological critique of the transparency agenda and the purported relationship between institutional openness and public trust. Drawing upon Simmel’s work, the article argues that open government initiatives routinely prize visibility over intelligibility and ignore the communicative basis of trust. The result is a non-reciprocal form of openness that obscures more than it reveals. In making this point the article suggests that transparency embodies the ethos of a now-discredited mode of what Ezrahi calls ‘instrumental politics’, reliant on the idea that the state constitutes a ‘domain of plain public facts’. The article examines how alternative mechanisms for achieving government openness might better respond to the distinctive needs of citizens living in late modern societies.",sociology
10.1177/0268580909351324,"This article deals with the position of the Southern sociologies within the discipline. The role and presence of local, national and regional scholarly communities has been widely reflected on in the context of the discussion around internationalization or globalization of the discipline. Thus, a variety of critiques of ‘Eurocentrism’, or more precisely, ‘North Atlantic domination’, have arisen in recent years that can be strengthened by empirical evidence of strong inequalities and distorted communication mechanisms within sociology at an international level. What has been largely missing so far is the demonstration of viable alternatives to North Atlantic domination, as well as enquiries into the conditions of their emergence. This article offers a different perspective by highlighting counterhegemonic currents emerging out of the South despite the peripheral position, i.e. by drawing attention towards challenging scholarly communities and their output that have not received much, if any, attention in the discussions so far.",sociology

The article divides the field in works that study media inwards – along the threefold dimensions of production and technologies, communication and discourse, reception and effects – and works that study media outwards. We argue that this latter perspective, examining broader theoretical, methodological, and substantive social implications of mass‐mediated communication, is the most promising one for a mature field of American media sociology. On this basis, we conclude with some suggestions regarding possible new, and as of yet understudied, lines of inquiry for future media sociologists.",sociology
10.1177/1749975517718435,"This article proposes a cross-cultural, comparative architectural sociology as a means of sociological analysis. It also emphasizes the social positivity of architecture. After a short overview of architectural sociology and its history, the article outlines a sociological theory which sees architecture and related practices as a constitutive ‘mode of collective existence’. The article argues that architecture (in a broad sense) is not a mere ‘reflection’ or ‘mirror’ of society, but rather a constitutive and transformative medium of the imaginary institution of society (Castoriadis), its assemblages (Deleuze), as well as its subjects (Foucault). In other words, it claims that architecture is a material and symbolic ‘mode’ through which societies and individuals are constituted and transformed. As architecture is a cultural technique, which is primarily enacted in relation to bodies, perceptions and affects (rather than in a discursive, reflective way), the social effects of architecture can best be understood and analysed through a comparative lens. Finally, therefore, the article unfolds a tableau of diverse architectural modes of collective existence, thus providing an overview of different socio-architectural constellations. Such a comparative and synchronical view of different societies allows for a sociology of architecture which analyses architectural transformations – both historical and contemporary.",sociology

China’s environmental entanglements call out for the analysis and understanding that environmental sociologists practice. Environmental sociologists from within and beyond China have begun to explore how society, polity, and ecology intersect, but we have yet to fully take on the challenges that China’s environmental struggles pose. This article focuses on four domains in which China’s experience compels us to rethink our theories: environmental ideology, political economy, civil society and environmental justice, and international environmental politics. In each domain, China’s institutions, discourses, and place in the world-system reframe major currents of thought in environmental sociology. These points challenge us to decenter environmental sociologists’ focus on how things happen within liberal polities in the global North; they likewise push us to reconsider arguments about the South. Together, these challenges present an opportunity to extend our theory and practice, fashioning a more global environmental sociology.",sociology

Looking carefully at these WR sections, however, two things seem puzzling. The first is that the criteria for defining a WR varies considerably from textbook to textbook; the second is that these WRs sections contain little or no sociology. These puzzles are resolved, however, once we understand that under the guise of promoting “diversity,” these sections are really affirming the universality of what has long been identified as a distinctively modern and very Western view of religion. The article concludes with some practical suggestions for improving the religion chapters in introductory textbooks. One such suggestion is that paying more attention to Native American “religion” would be a useful way of introducing students to the view that religion is a social construction that has no stable transhistorical and transcultural meaning.",sociology

It is an expression of existing social conditions, which determine how we perceive and control our physical selves, how we use our body as an expressive medium, how we handle our body and control it, how we make use of our bodies, and how we view our body. When we speak of our body as a social fact, we mean the following four elements:  a) the ""techniques of the body"", or in other words, the way motion (e.g., walking, running, jumping, swimming) is traditionally realized in a society;  b) ""expressive body movement"" such as posture, gesture, facial expressions and so on, which serve as symbolic forms of self-expression and of (non-verbal) communication; hence, as ""body language"";  c) ""body ethos"" or the attitude towards one's own body, which match person al and social identity;  d) controls of drive and need.  Every society recognizes, and also usually differentiates on a class and gen der-specific basis, a norm for each of these dimensions of the body which firmly establishes body techniques, expressive body movement, body ethos, and physical self-control. Such norms apply to all bodily movements and to the control of drives and needs; hence also to sports.  What is ""possible"" and ""not possible"" in sports, what is acceptable in bodily exertion, body control, posture, which presentation of the body is acceptable for men and women, for old and young, for members of the lower or the upper class, is defined by just such social norms and rules, that determine the body as a social fact.  These relationships should be examined in detail, if we wish to judge the significance of body sociology for the sociology of sports. For this, it is necessary:  1) to make clear the anthropological prerequisites of a sociology of the body,  2) to describe the already mentioned individual components of the body as a social fact to classify its socio-cultural, class and gender-specific differentiations and,  3) to treat the specific dependence-relationship of the body as a social fact upon social development.",sociology

Currently, there are unmistakeable signs that constitutional sociology is being consolidated as a distinct sub-discipline of theoretical sociology as a whole. This is evident in particular in the body of sociological constitutionalism associated with post-Luhmannian systems analysis, which focuses especially on the constitutions of world society.

The engagement of sociologists in these struggles may entail suppressing critical issues, steering clear of questions about internal democracy, ideological contradictions or long-term strategy.

10.1177/0011392112469309,"Sociology has been a subject of extensive debate in South Africa, especially over the last two decades. Central to the debate on sociology as a discipline and practice were efforts to document its history and paradigmatic shifts that characterized it, as well as topical themes that defined its research. One key observation in its evolution pointed to a historical shift from being a service discipline to the previous racially segregatory political regimes, especially between the early 1900s and 1960s, to a multi-paradigm discipline that challenged the racial order and inequalities in the 1970s onwards. This period marked the height of public sociology. Recent observations, however, especially in the post-apartheid period, projected a scenario of the discipline in a state of decline. Counter-evidence was nevertheless also presented suggesting not only the renewal of sociology in South Africa but also its active interest and involvement in the struggle against inequalities as part of the voices of the poor. This article calls these observations as the decline thesis and the renewal thesis, and contrasts them. The latter, I argue, is more compelling than the former. Notwithstanding this, the article argues however that the extent to which sociology in involved in struggles against inequalities is under question since public sociology, unlike in the 1970s and 1980s, is underdeveloped.",sociology

It is based on an analysis of CNAA course documents for degrees in sociology and the social sciences, and undertaken with the aim of contributing to the current debate on the content of the undergraduate curriculum in sociology. The survey results suggest several trends in curricular policy: in particular an increasing emphasis on practical competence and familiarity with procedures and techniques, and a greater recognition of `methodological pluralism', although qualitative methods are still given only a marginal place in many courses. There was little evidence of progress in the teaching of quantitative skills, nor was computing yet seen to be a core element of the curriculum. The documents also revealed a continuing problem over the place of methods teaching as a whole in relation to other parts of the curriculum as reflected both in time allocation and in assessment weighting. It is argued that if the claims of sociology to practical and vocational relevance are to become genuine for students wishing to pursue research in a variety of careers, then research methods teaching needs to be brought out of the ghetto. It is the contention of the authors that this is not just a pragmatic consideration: such a change would also benefit sociology as a discipline.",sociology

However, despite its certain shared assumptions, field theory in sociology encompasses three distinct, albeit interrelated, approaches: the Bourdieusian, New Institutionalist, and Strategic Action Fields perspectives. I comparatively outline the key analytical assumptions and causal claims of each version of field theory, whether and how it recognizes the specificity of the non‐profit sector and then delineate its application by sociologists to the non‐profit sector. I show how scholars' employment of each articulation of field theory to study non‐profit activity has been influenced by pre‐existing scholarly assumptions and normative claims about this third space. The article concludes by summarizing the use of these varieties of field theory in the sociology of the non‐profit sector and by identifying future directions in this line of research.",sociology

Such an analysis of continuities and ruptures shows the theoretical convergences among Latin America as a region and the political dynamics of specific historical processes. I highlight how the conceptions of 21st-century Ecuadorian populism as a “passive revolution” or “authoritarian disfigurement of democracy” provide some theoretical tools for examining the historical process of Ecuadorian populism but ultimately fall short of critical analysis. In conclusion, I derived from the Ecuadorian case some elements for the analysis of Latin American populist projects.",sociology

The data of a survey of 9751 students of higher education institu-tions of the Russian Federation, who are citizens of the Russian Federation are ana-lyzed in the article.

Although young people, for the most part, realize the value of folk culture as a whole, they rank its elements according to the degree of their compliance with the needs of modernity. Two groups of approximately equal size were distinguished. The first group is «iden-tification». It shares the position that if a modern person feels that he belongs to a certain ethnic group and is interested in preserving its traditions, he or she must know the folk culture well. The second group stands for «cultural diversity», which means that a modern person should know his or her folk culture well, but it is also important to navigate the cultural heritage of other peoples. Based on the results of the study, the conclusion about the need for a constant intergenerational dialogue for the preservation, transmission and reproduction of folk culture, which is the fundamental basis of the national mentality and the stability of society is made.",sociology

By distinguishing between good and bad, tasteful and tasteless, beautiful and ugly, taste classifies and orders the natural and social world. By taste one classifies oneself and is classified by others. Understood in this way, the sociological concept of taste shares many important features with its predecessor in classical philosophical aesthetics, the power of judgment. In this capacity, taste does not just refer either to individual preferences or dispositions (the term used by Bourdieu), or to some standards used in making choices in consumption. It is an important concept in bridging the gap between an individual's choices and his or her socially shared preferences or habits. In addition, it can refer to more or less automatic responses as well as to highly reflective acts of judgment, and to behavioral responses which share both these aspects at the same time.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0211,"<p>Classification is fundamental to social life. It is the prerequisite to all other social activity. Before language, family, power, or organization, there must be rules for expressing sameness and difference, for defining what is or is not an instance of something, and there must be rules for how these distinctions are connected. Understanding space, time, or causal relationships, that something is an “independent” or “dependent variable” and that they are connected to each other, are social relationships that depend on classification; so, too, is the discovery of chance and the understanding of life in stochastic, probabilistic terms. Classification can be a simple distinction of kinds (this is an animal, that is not), but it is usually organized into systems of division and hierarchy, of more and less, better and worse. Kinship is about who and how we are connected to family or clan or tribe. Nationalism is about how someone is a citizen and the kinds of relationships that citizens and noncitizens have. Power is about who and when someone has the right to impose their will on others. And status is about social worth that is distributed based on race, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexual preferences, what people buy, who is beautiful, who is good at sports, and so on. Sociologists may take categories for granted, but some branches—those who study culture, politics, or race—are especially concerned with how classifications emerge, spread, or change over time. Changes in economic or political relationships often require a reclassification of worth or merit. And the terms that define categories are most often controlled by those who most benefit from them; however, efforts to resist power often involve challenging categories favoring the powerful.</p>",sociology

The sociology of religion is concerned with the multiplicity of ways in which religion is part of human society and thus it focuses on its institutional, cultural, and individual expression across varying social, geographical, and historical contexts. A common typology is to differentiate between substantive and functional approaches to studying religion. The former is concerned with the symbolic contents or meanings contained within a religious worldview and the latter with religion's purposes or functions in society. Following Weber's (1958) analysis of the doctrinal tenets of the Calvinist ethic, substantive approaches focus on delineating particular religious beliefs, defined in terms of concerns about transcendence and other‐worldly salvation, and how these beliefs are understood and give meaning to everyday life.",sociology

Based on the so-called double periphery – the peripheral location of Argentine sociology in the western social sciences, but also of cultural research within local sociology – the author seeks to analyze the emergence of this subdiscipline. It owes to both the concern for mass culture and its relationship with populism at the end of the 1960s. At that time, these studies were being done by researchers with training in literary criticism, researchers who approached cultural phenomena as a political concern, in a way similar to what occurred when British cultural studies were born. At the end of Argentina’s last dictatorship (1976–1983), the reappearance and growth of a sociology of culture expanded into Nomadic terrains and into varied themes and institutions: this was due to a proliferation of studies in social communication and new university departments, but it can also be attributed to the influence of Brazilian anthropology. Another factor is the delayed creation of graduate programs and their clearly multidisciplinary nature. Today the field is testing its potential while undergoing both quantitative and qualitative growth.

An energetic founding group created a network of departments, assembled a workforce and were rewarded with rapid growth. Their intellectual project emphasized data collection, scientificity and social reform, closely modelled on sociology in the global metropole. Underneath was a mostly functionalist concept of ‘a society’ and a strong conviction that Australian society was a case of modernity. They succeeded in creating an empiricist science, which played a role in Australian reformism in the 1970s and 1980s, and reached a high point in the work of Jean Martin. However many younger sociologists were dissatisfied with the founders’ science and launched other knowledge projects in the following decades. The founders’ strategy for making sociology in Australia led to a deep contradiction about Australian coloniality, unresolved in contemporary sociology.",sociology

Both Weber and Schumpeter wrote voluminously on capitalism, as testified to by such giant works as Economy and Society (Weber, 1978c [1922]) and Business Cycles (Schumpeter, 1939). One can also discern a distinct development in their thought over time: from emphasizing the role of various voluntaristic elements (such as the spirit of capitalism and the spirit of entrepreneurship) to stressing the role of institutions. The puzzle that one can find in their writings is as follows. Weber and Schumpeter both argue that a vigorous and healthy capitalism requires certain economic and non-economic institutions, in addition to something else. An absence of this ‘something else’ may lead to capitalist petrification or collapse, according to both authors. The answers of Weber and Schumpeter to the above puzzle, it is shown in the article, is somewhat different in their early and in their later works.",sociology

However, to date the articulation of an African-centered sociology, grounded in an African-centered conceptual framework, has not developed; neither has it occurred for African-centered sociology as a sub-discipline of Africana Studies, a sub-discipline of traditional sociology, or as a stand-alone discipline, itself.

These ‘paradigm wars’ reached something of a zenith around the time of the final opus of a key proponent, Alvin Gouldner, in 1979. An uneasy truce was then reached under new conditions of growing economic rationalism. While mainstream academic sociology plunged into the ‘coming crisis’ foretold by Gouldner, a number of its graduates continued to develop reflexive sociology, particularly in non-academic workplaces. Initially called - after Kuhn - the ‘new paradigm’ or ‘critical interpretivism’, it is now known by many names. Most common descriptors would be participatory or action research, action learning or socio systems-thinking. The approach has gradually achieved surprising critical mass in enormously diverse organizational, workplace and community settings worldwide. The article concludes by noting that many ‘new paradigm’ assumptions have begun to enter mainstream social research, which may be beginning to reengage with the action research field - originally the offspring of sociological thinking three decades earlier.",sociology

10.1177/1749975520922469,"When analyzing literary fiction, most cultural sociologists still accept the well-established boundaries between the literary and the sociological, thus leaving literature stripped of its aesthetic qualities. Instead, I propose a new approach that focuses on the process of meaning-making as it occurs within the interaction between the reader and the novel in a given socio-historical setting. This allows analysts to capture those aspects of understanding social experience which are usually ‘lost in translation’ between fictional and sociological genres. My major claims are that, first, when referring to social experience, both sociological and literary texts employ aesthetic devices to mediate understanding for the reader. Second, within the literary genre, the understanding of social experience relies much more on the emotional engagement of the reader through a reading process facilitated by these aesthetic devices. Third, to benefit methodologically and epistemologically from the lyrical understanding of social experience mediated by literature, cultural sociologists must be particularly sensitive to the subtlety and ambiguity of meanings mediated by the aesthetic. The methodological advantage gained is the analysis of deeper cultural meanings grounded in, yet also going beyond, an emotionally and existentially experienced social reality, which is intersubjectively shared and filtered by various groups of readers and cultural intermediaries. The epistemological advantage gained by overcoming the assumed inferiority of literature is that cultural sociological research unlocks a whole new area for understanding the meanings of social life, especially its non-discursive dimensions. The research model I propose for a new sociology of literature adopts the landscape of meaning concept developed by Isaac Reed in combination with the aesthetic structuralism of Czech linguist Jan Mukařovský. This model will be demonstrated through an interpretive analysis of the Czech novel Sestra (published in English as City Sister Silver) by Jáchym Topol.",sociology

These regime types are distinguished by the nature of the party system — respectively, multi-party and monopolistic — and their underlying principles. Aron’s approach to the nature of political sociology is, it is argued, deeply influenced by the German — particularly Weberian — understanding of the social sciences as a hermeneutic enterprise concerned with meaning, and by Montesquieu’s analysis of regimes in terms of their (essential) nature, principles and the sources of their potential ‘corruption’. Aron’s analysis provides not only an account of totalitarian regimes in a late, developed stage, but also an analytical snapshot of Western pluralist democracies at the high point of ‘sociological liberalism’. The final section of the paper seeks to identify some differences between Aron’s account of democracy and that contained in contemporary debates on ‘governance’. The striking differences that emerge make Aron’s analysis relevant as an account of a high-tide mark of democracy grounded in a particular mix of party competition and compromise.",sociology
10.1177/0011392107070134,"The aim of this article is to discuss the relationship between economic sociology and economic policies. In the last few decades, economic sociology has made significant achievements in terms of theory and research, but its influence on policies has remained weak. While this was inevitable in earlier decades, when scholars had to concentrate most of their effort on defining the role and contribution of economic sociology, it has since become a constraint for the institutionalization and recognition of the discipline. The return to economic sociology, since the 1980s, has brought about important theoretical achievements, especially in the analysis of economic organization at the micro level in terms of social and cultural embeddedness. The role of social relations in contemporary economy has clearly emerged, but its implications for policies to promote economic development have remained more latent so far. Although a weaker institutionalization and a poorer connection to policy-making certainly affect the political influence of economic sociology in comparison to economics, the article focuses on the research perspective. A shift of the research focus from the statics to the dynamics of economic organization could be useful. In this framework, particular attention is drawn to the study of local development and innovation through a closer relationship of economic sociology with comparative political economy. A separation between these two approaches does not favour a full exploitation of the potential contribution of economic sociology to policies.",sociology
10.1177/00113921221090253,"This article asks whether we need a posthumanist sociology, arguing that such a perspective can export a good deal of useful methodological and theoretical insight into the sociological toolbox. A posthumanist sociology is not a flattened ontology, in which we find agency in all things living and non-living. A posthumanist sociology asks instead what we do with the fundamental question of becoming both more and less human, following a surge of interest in decentring human exceptionalism. Moreover, a posthumanist sociology returns to the question of what it means to be an intersectional being, to proliferate the involvement of entities at the intersections of histories and social structures. Thus, it is a perspective that emerges from within the conditions of related crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has highlighted the need to decentre human exceptionalism, raising a challenge for sociologists to return to the premises of what it means to be a social being. In some sense, management of the pandemic already assumes a decentring. This article builds an argument by first reviewing what broadly constitutes a ‘posthumanist’ sociological perspective, then moves on to a case study of the interrelated human and non-human actors that constituted the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The case study usefully marks the intersection between human and non-human bodies as nodes in the interpretive production chain of this global event – one that acknowledges human extensions and connections to multispecies and ecological systems. Such interlinkages become foundational to interrogating what it means to become human in a posthuman world. The article ends on this posthuman question: under the posthuman condition, if we do not discern a difference between the human and other-than-human entities, how will this homogenization affect the human collective ability to enact and maintain cross-species and cross-entity protections?",sociology

Early preoccupation with community studies and the fate of the Welsh language gave way to questions of economic decline and structural inequality. Themes of uneven development, social and economic restructuring and internal colonialism were explored. The nature of Welsh identity was problematised.

This article outlines the sociology of loss as a project for sociological engagement with climate change, one that breaks out of environmental sociology as the conventional silo of research and bridges to other subfields. I address four interrelated dimensions of loss that climate change presents: the materiality of loss; the politics of loss; knowledge of loss; and practices of loss. Unlike “sustainability”—the more dominant framing in the social sciences of climate change—the sociology of loss examines what does, will, or must disappear rather than what can or should be sustained.

To evaluate the extent to which family sociology has kept pace with these changes the article first reviews four prominent sociology journals from 1993 to 2011, investigating the range of family types covered in published articles over nearly two decades and the kinds of approaches taken to study non-traditional families. The article then presents two case studies of research areas that have always been central to family studies – reproduction and household labor – to review how changes in family structure impact core family processes and alter the approaches for studying them. The advent of assisted reproductive technologies and the range of living arrangements in which the division of household labor now occurs challenge the parameters of the ‘traditional’ family. The findings indicate that family sociologists have been slow to rethink underlying categories of analysis, methodological approaches and scope of inquiry in the wake of significant changes in family experience.

By distinguishing between good and bad, tasteful and tasteless, beautiful and ugly, taste classifies and orders the natural and social world. By taste one classifies oneself and is classified by others. Understood in this way, the sociological concept of taste shares many important features with its predecessor in classical philosophical aesthetics, the power of judgment. In this capacity, taste does not just refer to individual preferences, or dispositions (the term used by Bourdieu), or to some standards used in making choices in consumption. It is an important concept in bridging the gap between an individual's choices and his/her socially shared preferences or habits.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0253,"<p>The sociological study of gender and social movements is relatively new. Until the 1970s, scholarship on social movements largely neglected questions of feminism and gender, and the fields of gender and social movements consisted of separate literatures. As a result, the major theories of social movements failed to take into account the impact of gender on the emergence, nature, and outcomes of social movements. But as mass feminist activism flourished in the United States and around the globe, so too did scholarship on gender and social movements. The earliest work in this area focused on women’s movements, both feminist and antifeminist, and applied the concepts and perspectives of social movement theory without explicitly taking into consideration the impact of gender. These studies, along with research on men’s movements, brought gender to the attention of social movement scholars by acknowledging women’s participation in political protest and men’s political experiences in gender movements, which had been ignored by mainstream social movement theory. But this body of work failed to consider systematically the effects of gender on political activism. By the 1990s, a new wave of research began to reconceptualize the relationship between gender and social movements by attending not only to how gender affects social movement structures and processes, but how social movements, in turn, affect gender. Many social movements have targeted the structures, cultural practices, and interactional norms that sustain gender inequality. Further, movements that are not oriented specifically around gender issues are also shaped by gender as a central feature of social structure, culture, and everyday life. Scholarship at the intersection of the fields of gender and social movements has had a significant impact on the cultural turn in social movement research, as well as on mainstream theories of social movements. Examining social movements through a gender lens has advanced several areas of social movement inquiry: (1) collective identity and intersectionality, (2) collective action frames, (3) movement leadership and organizations, (4) political and cultural opportunity structures and constraints, (5) movement tactics and strategies, and (6) movement outcomes. The research in this subfield and, correspondingly, this article, focuses primarily—but not exclusively—on the United States. The literature on gender and social movements has exposed many underexplored dimensions of social activism and has been foundational for the development of intersectional approaches to social movements. There is still much to learn by applying an intersectional approach that considers how power structures such as race, class, gender, and nationality intersect and the implications for social movement processes.</p>",sociology

The growth of women in prison in the 2010s has outpaced the growth of male prisoners. Not only are women a growing prison population, they are also a unique prison population. Women prisoners, compared to their male counterparts, are more likely to have histories of abuse and neglect and have greater incidents of substance abuse and mental health concerns. Women prisoners are also more likely to be the primary caretakers of children under the age of eighteen. The incarceration of women, then, has a substantial impact not only on the women who experience it, but on their families. Women prisoners also pose a unique challenge for correctional officials. The US correctional system was developed for males and is staffed and run largely by men. As such, risk assessment tools and in-prison programming do not consider the special needs of women prisoners. However, when programming takes into consideration women’s unique pathways into crime, they are much more effective. This article considers, in turn, each of these issues, beginning with a historical understanding of women’s prisons.

Thirty years later, it is estimated that around 36 million people are living with HIV, with 95 percent living in low‐ and middle‐income countries (UNAIDS, 2013). There is at present no cure for AIDS and no effective prophylactic vaccine for HIV, and the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In 1996 a successful treatment was developed, anti‐retro viral therapy (ART), which blocks HIV from entering the body's immune cells to effectively slow the progression from HIV to AIDS to death. As a result the number of AIDS deaths is declining with 1.6 million AIDS deaths in 2012, down from 2.3 million in 2005. Although ART lowers the viral load, it does not eradicate the virus in those infected, and the number of people living with HIV worldwide (HIV prevalence) is increasing. Furthermore, for every person who initiates treatment, between three and four more persons become infected. On a more positive note, since 1999, the year in which it is thought that the epidemic peaked globally, the number of new infections (HIV incidence) has fallen. The overall growth of the global epidemic appears to have stabilized with the annual number of new HIV infections steadily declining; although levels remain high with around 2.3 million new infections globally in 2012, a 33 percent decline from 3.4 million in 2001 (UNAIDS, 2013).",sociology

This article presents findings from qualitative interviews with men (n = 25) who do not (yet) have children about their experiences of intimate relationship establishment and progression and imaginaries of fatherhood, presenting three themes: dating as elusive, fatherhood as elusive for unpartnered men and intimate relationships as risky. Findings are discussed in relation to theories of connection and connectedness, and theories of masculinities to consider how narratives are structurally shaped by gender.

Examples of the development of analogical problems in the works of domestic and foreign authors have been given. The possibilities of scientific and methodological support of social experiments on the development and implementation of educational Internet communications to overcome the disability of disabled people using the Arsenal of digital sociology have been described separately. The data on the attitude of disabled people to higher education in the system of their rehabilitation and life activity, with the identification of social groups with positive, uncertain and negative attitudes with a predominant positive attitude to the possibility of educational rehabilitation have been provided. The educational needs of people with disabilities in various areas have been described, their quantitative characteristics with the definition of priorities and areas of education that are not relevant for people with disabilities have been presented. A significant place in the article has been given to the possibilities of involving disabled people in the process of developing educational programs and in research activities, both in terms of the availability of willing people among them, and the use of various forms of their integration into real research projects as part of temporary creative teams. The conditions for the implementation of scientific support for the development of training programs in the Internet space by conducting their practical testing on the example of the Zagorsk experiment have been characterized separately. Attention to supporting individual research projects of people with disabilities in the course of higher education has been paid, ways to help them collect experimental material have been substantiated. Separately, the role and place of joint forms of scientific activity of disabled people, teachers and students in the performance of state tasks have been shown.

The review is based on the study of programmatic statements, the character of references in sociological writings, and available biographical information on their authors. All of these help to locate Soviet sociology within the intellectual enterprise in general and to establish whether it is actually a counterpart of what is called “sociology” in the West, or a different branch of intellectual activity which for some reason uses its name. Most of the findings are derived from an analysis of Sotsiogicheskie lssledovania (Sociological Research), the only specifically sociological journal in the USSR, published since 1974. These findings are compared with parallel observations on representative samples of the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review. The conclusion is that Soviet sociology, although it uses some of the methods of Western sociology, is an activity of a different nature on the whole. It is a branch of social technology, a managerial science oriented towards the promotion of the goals and the increase of the ideological and administrative efficiency of the Soviet government.",sociology

In view of the rela tively low esteem accorded to sport sociology (at least in the United States) it may be proper to emphasize that the problems discussed above are by no means limited to the area of sport sociology. Indeed, they are to be found in the most respectable literature of fields more in the ""mainstream"" of sociology (see Deutscher, 1973; Hirschi and Selvin, 1967). Hopefully, a continuing concern for better methodology among sport sociologists will help us to draw on the methodological wisdom of ""general sociology"" and other related fields without repeating the errors that have been made by scholars in those fields.  A number of recent papers and exchanges in this journal and elsewhere have marked an apparent growth of interest in methodological issues among sport socio logists (e.g., Loy and Seagrave, 1974; Albonico and Pfister-Binz, 1971; McPherson, 1975: Wohl, 1975). This trend, especially the emergence of exchanges and discus sions regarding the relative merit of different methodological approaches (cf. Wohl, 1975 and McPherson, 1975; Lenk and Lüschen, 1975), may be seen as a sign of maturation of sport sociology as a field of inquiry.

It is also a potentially difficult topic for sociology because of the importance sociology attaches to culture and context. The sociology of science has emphasised the continuity between scientific expertise and more traditional forms of knowledge. Whilst this suggests an increasing ‘democratisation of expertise’ is desirable, it also risks erasing the idea of expertise itself. This might be particularly detrimental for sociology as it restricts the role of sociological inquiry to examining how expert status is attributed rather than understanding what expertise is. This paper describes these developments and contrasts them with other approaches in which expertise appears less important. It concludes by setting out a new approach to expertise that respects the role of culture in generating knowledge but, by stressing the importance of socialisation and experience, argues for a more nuanced conception of expertise as both real and unequally distributed.",sociology

This approach is based on Polanyi's critically debated contribution which allows for an empirical study of the diversity of institutional structures and of the significance of configurations of insertion within different social networks. Such diversity results from the double movement of disembeddedness and re-embeddedness caused by the spread of constantly emerging market opportunities, and by the importance held by the historically and culturally different selective processes of path dependency in the construction of the institutions of social regulation and of the socialized preferences of economic actors.

10.1177/0038038516656994,"Professor Akiwowo propounded the Asuwada Theory of Sociation in the 1980s as a contextual episteme to explain African social experience. The theory particularly attempts an indigenous postulation to social interactions among Africans in general and the Yoruba in particular. Its concepts attempt to emphasise contextual values of social beings who would contribute to social survival and community integration and development. This theory postulates that among Africans in general and the Yoruba in particular, the need to associate or co-exist by internalising and rightly exhibiting socially approved values of community survival and development, is integral to local social structure, as failure to co-exist potentially endangers the community. A deviant who defaults in sociating values is deemed a bad person ( omoburuku), while the one who sociates is the good person ( omoluabi). This theoretical postulation contrasts western social science theories (especially sociological Structuralist (macro) and Social Action (micro) theories), which rather emphasise rationality and individualism (at varied levels depending on the theory). Western social science ethnocentrically depicts African communal and kin ways of life as primitive and antithetical to development. Western social science theories have remained dominant and hegemonic over the years while Akiwowo’s theory is largely unpopular even in Nigerian social science curricula in spite of its potential for providing contextual interpretations for indigenous ways of life that are still very much extant despite dominant western modernity.

This review identifies global inequality and disease‐related stigma as key social determinants of health and central problems improving health outcomes. Within global health, there is a growing discourse surrounding health disparities, particularly among the world's most disadvantaged populations. Additionally, the field notes an increase in global health nonprofits, international governmental organizations (IGOs), and regulatory bodies. As such, this paper examines the scope of empirical global health research with consideration of inequality and stigma as well as the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in health outcomes for the developing world. The review also discusses the role of IGOs and global health regulatory bodies in shaping development and health outcomes. A broad review of literature finds that although chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are currently the largest cause of poor health in the world's most impoverished nations, these are largely untargeted by NGO efforts, which may exacerbate the state of global inequality. However, the impact that NGOs could have on ameliorating the effects of NCDs remains understudied and is a promising direction for future scholarly efforts.",sociology

10.1177/0038038514551089,"The article highlights two contrasting ways in which social theorists have been trying to define the ontological boundaries of sociology since the early days of the discipline. Some (e.g. Durkheim, Weber, and critical realists) have attempted to demarcate social reality as a causally autonomous and qualitatively distinct realm in a segmented/stratified universe. Others (e.g. Tarde, Spencer, Luhmann, sociobiologists, and actor-network theorists) have postulated a more open (or flat) ontological space and blurred such demarcations by either rejecting the causal autonomy of sociological phenomena, or their qualitative distinctiveness, or both. So far, there has been little convergence between these two orientations since according to the former, the opening of the boundaries is likely to give way to reductionist conceptions of society, whereas the latter tends to associate rigid boundaries with essentialism. Through a close examination of these opposing orientations, the article aims to shed light on current ontological dilemmas of sociology.",sociology

Seen from a French point of view, so-called ‘French theory’ appears as a typically Anglo-American category, along with ‘post-modernism’, while French debates among sociologists of art seem to have few echoes abroad.

Eisenstadt was one of the great sociologists of the second half of the twentieth century and a major visionary for the sociological challenges of the twenty-first century. As I claim, his overall work should be understood as a life-long critical conversation with the classical modernization paradigm from a heterodox and peripheral point of view — reflecting the Holocaust experience of European modernity as well as the precarious construction of a modern society in Israel. As such, his oeuvre can be viewed as an alternative, neo-Weberian synthesis of classical sociology to mainstream sociology. To demonstrate this claim, I firstly reconstruct Eisenstadt’s heterodox theory of modernity, emphasizing the tensions, contradictions and paradoxes of global modernity. Secondly, I highlight the contours of his comparative-civilizational, multiple modernities approach that has materialized in numerous path-breaking analyses of several civilizations — not only of Western but particularly of non-Western civilizational complexes. Thirdly, I emphasize the innovative research direction of his civilizational analysis for the new field of world history. Fourthly, I show also his innovative research direction in the recently growing area of the sociology of globalization and world society.

Urban and rural sociology should be concerned with the relations between political economy on the one hand and the biological and psychological bases of human behaviour on the other. Recent developments in the human sciences and psychology assist in making this link. They can be used to extend the original insights of the early Chicago School of sociology, particularly as regards the formation of human identities. Nevertheless, there remain substantial arguments as to how `the Chicago School's biotic level' should be conceptualised and how we envisage its links to the more conscious, pre-planned, aspects of human behaviour.

However, we are somewhat reluctant to interpret this as a kind of Irish Sonderweg or Irish exceptionalism. What remains noticeable though is a relatively late willingness to connect to the outside world – culturally and intellectually. This is partly explained by several decades of Catholic institutional dominance. The challenges since late secularisation of the field occurred in the 1970s have included epistemological dominance of the rather narrow posivitist type. Within this context university-based sociologists and sociologies have often been perceived as self-marginalised figures and paradigms.

Following a review of main points from Mauss’s lectures, I critically review several research programs that are advancing in directions similar to those Mauss advocated: cognitive science research on embodied cognition; psychology studies of cross-cultural differences in perception and emotional expression; and sociological studies of moral cultures.

Yet, despite its significance, ignorance has appeared a largely secondary concern among sociologists. Perhaps more perplexing, while sociologists of racism, power, and domination have long focused on the ways racial ideologies distort and mystify racial understanding to sustain White supremacy over time, we have done less to elaborate ignorance than is possible and warranted. Here, I join growing calls for a fully‐fledged “sociology of ignorance” and argue that antiracist and decolonial scholars have much to gain from and contribute to such an endeavor. This article traces the historical forebears of a “sociology of ignorance” and explores ignorance as a social concept before turning to examine precedents and increasing attention to ignorance scholarship on racism, racial domination, and racialized non‐knowing.

Because of the political environment within which they worked, Soviet researchers of culture had to employ strategies of resistance to survive. The three most common were: finding niches in related, ideologically neutral disciplines; doing purely empirical work; or, in contrast, critiquing ‘bourgeois social theories’. They also opted to work in the modes of reading rather than writing, oral discussions rather than publishing, and communication with like-minded colleagues rather than debates with opponents.

In the pre-state era, sociological thought thrived within the context of the socialist Zionism. The two prominent ‘proto-sociologists' were Arthur Ruppin and Martin Buber, who professed German communal perspectives. 2. Modernization sociology.

The critical phase took place in the 1970s and 1980s. Critical sociology was manifested in elitism, pluralism, Marxism, feminism and colonization approaches. Simultaneously there emerged a robust branch of ‘quantitative sociology’. 4. Post-modern sociology. The turn towards post-modernity started in the 1990s.

It is also a potentially difficult topic for sociology because of the importance sociology attaches to culture and context. The sociology of science has emphasised the continuity between scientific expertise and more traditional forms of knowledge. Whilst this suggests an increasing ‘democratisation of expertise’ is desirable, it also risks erasing the idea of expertise itself. This might be particularly detrimental for sociology as it restricts the role of sociological inquiry to examining how expert status is attributed rather than understanding what expertise is. This paper describes these developments and contrasts them with other approaches in which expertise appears less important. It concludes by setting out a new approach to expertise that respects the role of culture in generating knowledge but, by stressing the importance of socialisation and experience, argues for a more nuanced conception of expertise as both real and unequally distributed.",sociology

Such diversity results from the double movement of disembeddedness and re-embeddedness caused by the spread of constantly emerging market opportunities, and by the importance held by the historically and culturally different selective processes of path dependency in the construction of the institutions of social regulation and of the socialized preferences of economic actors.

10.1177/0038038509340742,"Labour process analysis (LPA) is a well-established approach to the sociological study of work which attends to the instabilities of capitalism and, more specifically, to the volatile and contested nature of social relations at work. However, an unreflexive ‘neo-orthodoxy’ has emerged in recent years that is constrained by a series of dualistic and (critical) realist assumptions which inhibit the development of this distinctive sociology of work. This article contends that the potential of LPA can best be fulfilled through a renewal of critical reflection upon the foundational assumptions of LPA that can open up an acknowledgement and appreciation of the embroilment of subjectivity in the reproduction and transformation of production relations. This development is consistent with the central analytical importance ascribed to the ‘indeterminacy of labour’ in LPA but invites the adoption of a negative ontology in order to advance a less narrow conception of its meaning and significance. Studies of the new media and creative industries are engaged to indicate how a revitalized labour process analysis might embrace this ontology as a way of exploring and explaining the radical contingency of organization in contemporary social relations.",sociology

The vignettes were developed through an Image Theatre workshop, involving families living with early onset dementia. They were designed to capture key themes, issues and experiences that emerged from the group’s collective experience. While the content of the vignettes speaks to a range of key sociological debates (especially in relation to the lived experience of time, risk, social exclusion and stigma in dementia) the process of creating and using the vignettes represents the first empirical application of a (public) sociological approach to ‘person-centredness’ in dementia; which views persons as ‘dividual’ and selves as transactive.

Their interface and areas of overlap have mostly been shaped by theoretical positions broadly considered “social constructionist.” Taken together, these perspectives provide empirical and theoretical tools to analyze important questions about how social inequalities, forms of scientific knowledge, and patterns of human health come to be produced and feedback into one another. Examining their intersection enables sociological questions such as: How is medical and public health scientific knowledge produced, stabilized, and taken as fact? How are scientific facts about health and illness used, experienced, and challenged? What is the relationship between health inequalities and public health or medical knowledge? This article seeks to briefly trace the important contributions that social constructionist research has made at the interstices of medical sociology and STS, further clarifying the history, points of intersection, and areas of diversion between them. The current COVID‐19 pandemic has unveiled the political struggles that constitute public health scientific knowledge and circulation. The interface between STS and medical sociology can help us to make sense of the interrelationships between politics, power inequalities, and public health scientific knowledge.",sociology

Sociological analysis of these new wars often makes use of comparative historical sociology, but these are wars of state disintegration rather than of state formation.

The history of Israeli sociology and its conception of ‘Israeli society’ may be discerned into the five following modules: 1. Proto-sociology. In the pre-state era, sociological thought thrived within the context of the socialist Zionism. The two prominent ‘proto-sociologists' were Arthur Ruppin and Martin Buber, who professed German communal perspectives. 2. Modernization sociology. The formative phase of sociology as a discipline was from 1950 to 1977. It was led by Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt, who effected a transition from the German anti-modernist paradigm to an American modernization theory. 3. Critical sociology. The critical phase took place in the 1970s and 1980s. Critical sociology was manifested in elitism, pluralism, Marxism, feminism and colonization approaches. Simultaneously there emerged a robust branch of ‘quantitative sociology’. 4. Post-modern sociology. The turn towards post-modernity started in the 1990s. The three noticeable post-modern perspectives are: post-structuralism, post-colonialism and post-Marxism. 5. Palestinian Arab sociology in Israel.

The analysis highlights the effects of two groups of factors – one cultural, the other structural – the combination of which brought about various patterns at each stage of the discipline’s development. Because of the political environment within which they worked, Soviet researchers of culture had to employ strategies of resistance to survive. The three most common were: finding niches in related, ideologically neutral disciplines; doing purely empirical work; or, in contrast, critiquing ‘bourgeois social theories’. They also opted to work in the modes of reading rather than writing, oral discussions rather than publishing, and communication with like-minded colleagues rather than debates with opponents. Contemporary Russian sociology of culture displays this inheritance in being structured by the opposition between isolation and international integration, as well as the tension between an elitist vision of culture and the economically centered worldview which has been dominant since the 1990s.",sociology

Following a review of main points from Mauss’s lectures, I critically review several research programs that are advancing in directions similar to those Mauss advocated: cognitive science research on embodied cognition; psychology studies of cross-cultural differences in perception and emotional expression; and sociological studies of moral cultures.

Ignorance is socially constructed, negotiated, and pervasive; ignorance is often socially inevitable, even necessary; and, without a doubt, ignorance is socially consequential. Yet, despite its significance, ignorance has appeared a largely secondary concern among sociologists. Perhaps more perplexing, while sociologists of racism, power, and domination have long focused on the ways racial ideologies distort and mystify racial understanding to sustain White supremacy over time, we have done less to elaborate ignorance than is possible and warranted. Here, I join growing calls for a fully‐fledged “sociology of ignorance” and argue that antiracist and decolonial scholars have much to gain from and contribute to such an endeavor. This article traces the historical forebears of a “sociology of ignorance” and explores ignorance as a social concept before turning to examine precedents and increasing attention to ignorance scholarship on racism, racial domination, and racialized non‐knowing. Drawing from this work, I urge race‐critical scholars take advantage of our unique position to advance theory and methodology surrounding ignorance and the social‐cultural production of non‐knowledge as a broader area of social inquiry.",sociology

Postcolonial theory emphasizes the global, historical, and therefore colonial dimensions of race relations, including how imperialism has generated racial thought and racial stratification. A postcolonial sociology of race, therefore, would (1) analytically recover empire and colonialism and their legacies, (2) excavate colonial racialization and trace its continuities into the present, (3) reveal the reciprocal constitution of racialized identities that began under empire, and (4) critique the imperial standpoint and seek out the subjugated epistemologies of racialized subjects.

With the weakening of the demographic, territorial, economic, and political foundations of the French agricultural population, rural sociologists are now required to present a new analysis and a revised assessment of its position in French society. The object of this article is to promote better understanding of the reasons behind the blurring of images and representations associated with French agriculture. It invites readers to review and understand the different facets of an imagery that presents a paradox compared with the ideological constructs associated with the historical record of farming and the farming profession.

I argue that such a structural lens is essential to our understanding of the meso (institutional and disciplinary) levels of teaching sociology. I argue a nascent ‘teaching and learning movement’ in Irish sociology may be emerging. A number of factors that have facilitated this are identified. However even a quick glance at Irish higher education also reveals contradictions and conflicts which threaten this movement before it is even established, including worsening staff-student ratios, increased casualisation of teaching and the neo-liberal turn. The paper concludes with a call for more sociologically informed work both on teaching and learning in Irish higher education, and on teaching sociology. This would enable more informed involvement in critical debates around teaching excellence at the national and institutional levels.

As there is no doubt that only a substantial cultural change could counteract the trend, the article deals with that part of the western epistemic community that embodies the highest cultural capital, namely learned professions, by asking what theoretical and practical limits are they reaching? Are they accountable for the ongoing general situation? Are their knowledge, commitment and performance socially adequate? If not, do professional work, action and trustworthiness require new analytical, social and moral foundations? A plausible answer to these questions seems to be offered by the abandonment of traditionally dominant formal-rational methodology, a return to the concept of substantive rationality and the appraisal of the multidisciplinary advancements provided by sociology of science. In this respect, the analysis stresses the limits of dominant sociological approaches to professions, by centring on the notion of status-role and by enlightening the pivotal importance of the indeterminacy of knowledge as primary professional traits of professionalism. Consequently, it suggests the need for a radical theoretical revision of common views about sources, forms and degrees of socioprofessional reliability, trustworthiness and confidence, given the fact that such a revision is anyhow required in practice by the new trajectories of the profession power–knowledge nexus in the age of the risk–knowledge society.",sociology

One of the grounding ideas of visual sociology is that “valid scientific insight in society can be acquired by observing, analyzing and theorizing its visual manifestations: behavior of people and material products of culture” (Pauwels 2010: 546). Visual sociology aims to normalize the use of visual imagery as a valid and relevant type of data for sociological research. Visual sociology allows for using mixed methods, where quantitative and qualitative ones show different aspects of the studied phenomenon. Some recent studies on modern media, such as YouTube, demonstrate that both quantitative and qualitative methods can be combined (Vergani &amp; Zuev 2011). One of the important postulates in sociological analyses is consideration of image as data, and not as an illustration or embellishment of a sociological argument. A single image, a sequence of images, and even a repository of images cannot serve as visual sociology arguments in themselves without analyzing them utilizing sociological theory (thereby also developing the theoretical tool). Visual sociological analysis can be also presented with no images at all. Radically speaking, visual sociology can even analyze non‐visual data, for example, when interviewing people on how they create, interpret, and circulate images. In this case visual sociologists analyze data related to the social world around images and not specific images themselves.",sociology

Not only has there been exponential growth in the number of publications on religious phenomena in the region, but the field itself has also shifted from sociology about Latin American religion to a Latin American sociology of religion.

This chapter introduces four prominent Latin American sociologists of religion: Roberto Blancarte’s work on laicity; the critical analysis of Cristián Parker on popular religions within multiple modernities; Hugo José Suárez’s conceptualization of “para-ecclesiastical agents,” a key concept for understanding religious collective practice in Latin America; and Eloisa Martin’s proposal of the heuristic potential of analyzing practices of sacralization for understanding popular religion in Latin America.",sociology

The continued vitality of the field corresponds with material changes in an increasingly globalized capitalism, with more workers in the world, higher employment participation rates of women, transnational shifts in manufacturing, global expansion of services and temporal and spatial stretching of work with advanced information communication technologies. The article demonstrates that Labour Process Theory (LPT) has been a crucial resource in the sociology of work, especially in the UK; core propositions of LPT provide it with resources for resilience (to counter claims of rival perspectives) and innovation (to expand the scope and explanator y power of the sociology of work).

For a long time, the contribution of sociologists was in the vein of apologetics. They formulated functionalist explanations to show that new immigrants had to be pressured into assimilation. Homogenization of the increasingly variegated Jewish population was presented as a scientifically warranted goal, while groups who were not of ‘western’ origin and those defined as minority groups could be relegated to ‘otherness’ and ‘difference’. The self-presentation of Israel as ‘Jewish and democratic’ was supported by sociological theorizing about Israel as a ‘unique’ sociopolitical phenomenon. The patent theoretical and practical contradictions of the ideology tended to be explained away and for several decades of the state's existence, the official ideology was all but unchallenged. With the growth of the academic community of sociologists, and, paradoxically, with the dynamic right-wing changes in politics, economics and culture in train since the 1980s, sociology is increasingly coming into its own. More researchers now attempt to make sense of the changes in ways that are attuned to contradictions. They look at (Israeli) society as a universal multi-factor processthat is subject to discoverable social laws; take as subject matter not what society oughtto be, but primarily what society actually is; and increasingly sift statements and conclusions founded on empirical datain their aspiration to scientific truth.",sociology

I note oft‐stated critiques of the positivist model relevant to rural sociology's “methodological monism,” including imprecise measurement, low levels of predictability, and a social psychological orientation. I suggest, in addition, that methodological homogeneity in rural sociology presents social life as social facts rather than social process, leads to a simplistic understanding of the interview, and separates the researcher from the experience of research. A wider methodological orientation would, I suggest, encourage the examination of a wider range of issues and encourage wider participation in a subdiscipline which, because of its particular history, has developed in isolation from mainstream sociology.",sociology
10.1177/001139297045003001,"In recent years, an increasing number of sociologists have recognized that when human technologies disrupt the relationship between communities and environments, both communities and environments change. This change is caused both directly, by physical changes in the environment, and indirectly, through the appraisals people make of those disruptions and the social processes those appraisals set in motion. Such a situation can be called an `extreme environment', in which the disruption between communities and the physical environment narrows the range of what people know about their physical world while simultaneously intensifying their need to protect themselves by acting on that world with imperfect knowledge.  All the articles in this issue deal in one way or another with this type of extreme environment and its social impacts. The first looks at long-term environmental disruptions as a new type of disaster. The next three examine the relationship between risk and social policy. The development of grassroots and environmental justice movements is the focus of the next two articles.

10.1111/soc4.12020,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has been an extraordinarily influential figure in the sociology of music. For over three decades, his concepts have helped to generate both empirical and theoretical interventions in the field of study. His impact on the sociology of music taste, in particular, has been profound, his ideas directly informing our understandings of how musical preferences reflect and reproduce inequalities between social classes. But, recently his legacy has been under question and newer approaches to the music/society problematic have emerged. These have made important claims about the nature of the sociological enterprise when confronted with the specificity of cultural works, as well as how social change impacts on our relations with musical forms. This paper takes stock of the impact of Bourdieu’s ideas on the sociology of music, the debates sparked in their wake and the attempt at something like a “post‐Bourdieusian” sociology more faithful to music’s material properties. It will ask to what extent Bourdieu’s claims about social stratification and music consumption are still relevant and whether they are sophisticated enough to deal with the specific ways that we interact with musical forms.",sociology

In contradistinction to this standard view, which in current debates receives the name of methodological nationalism, I advance a re-interpretation of classical sociology's conceptualization of the nation-state that points towards what can be called the opacity of its position in modernity. Marx understood the historical elusiveness of the nation-state as he believed that it had already passed its heyday as political struggles were fought between Empires and the Commune. Weber captured the sociological equivocations that arose from the historical disjuncture between the nation and the state. And Durkheim, finally, tried to come to terms with the nation-state's normative ambiguity via the immanent tension between nationalism and cosmopolitanism. The conclusion is that, even if not thoroughly unproblematic, classical sociologists were able to avoid the reification of the nation-state's position in modernity precisely because they were not obsessed with conceptualizing modernity as such from the viewpoint of the nation-state.",sociology

While literature in this field has tended towards macro-institutionalist analysis, recent research has re-articulated post-nationalism as micro-level practice. This article builds on this development by attending to the ‘affective conditions’ of such micro-political practices. The article draws on research into protests in Brisbane in February 2016 to prevent ‘Asha’, a child seeking asylum, from being returned to offshore detention. The analysis of this case demonstrates that affect performs a dual function in the practice of post-nationalism, to catalyse action in solidarity with the noncitizen informed primarily by the emotional resonance of a particular rendering of vulnerability, and in re-imagined solidarity with the co-citizen around a post-national community of feeling. Informed by this analysis, the article highlights the complex and fragile nature of a post-national solidarity dependent on intersecting, overlapping and at times problematic, affective conditions.",sociology

Drawing on the sociology of knowledge, the article argues that Weber’s perspective is untenable conceptually and practically. Strong reflexivity, here illustrated through Standpoint Feminism and Bourdieusian sociology, permits a coherent delineation of the problem of the scholarly vocation, in a way that reconciles the social origins, efficacy and responsibility of science, and hence allows for a more realist reformulation of the cognitive, social and moral dilemmas we face as scholars, educators, and citizens.",sociology

The author endeavors to show that four difficulties can be successfully overcome. (1) The first is epistemological in nature. Human rights are often presented as legal norms. By relying on the Putman/Habermas debate, the author maintains that Sen’s epistemology is Putnamian, allowing us to treat human rights a system of values (rather than as a system of norms), thereby enabling the construction of a system of evaluation (the “goal rights system”) that is neither consequentialist nor deontological. This system is open to public deliberation and can thus take into account the systems of evaluation of participants (in addition to that of the observer). This epistemological basis serves to remove the other obstacles. (2) By defining the individual in terms of “capabilities”, Sen avoids a methodological individualism that would produce an under-socialized version of the individual. (3) He includes social, economic, and cultural rights in the list of human rights, whereas liberal philosophies tend to exclude these. (4) He allows for the thematization of the specific conversion factors that condition the transformation of formal rights into real freedoms (internormative culture, civilian legal intermediaries, access to resources and the capabilities to use them). Avoiding formalism, the capability approach is a valuable instrument for a critical sociology of human rights.",sociology

What are the characteristics of the theoretical environment, in which cultural sociology is operating? The article begins by reviewing the literature on interdisciplinarity. Many authors argue that interdisciplinarity is increasing or should be increasing, but the general consensus is that disciplinary isolation is the norm. From this perspective, the relationships between disciplines can be understood in terms of <jats:italic>trading zones</jats:italic>, in which fields in different disciplines have little in common, theoretically, or empirically. Interdisciplinary communication in ‘trading zones’ requires that participants laboriously construct a set of terms that permits them to exchange ideas. Alternatively, I propose that clusters of fields in different disciplines are linked by <jats:italic>free‐floating paradigms</jats:italic>. Participants in disciplines that share ‘free‐floating paradigms’ are able to communicate with one another more readily. The article presents evidence for the second interpretation, drawn from survey articles in disciplinary handbooks. Disciplines and fields in which the study of culture draws from the same pool of paradigms and models and shares a set of lines of inquiry with cultural sociology include traditional disciplines, such as anthropology, communication, geography, history and psychology, and interdisciplinary fields, such as cultural studies, communication, feminist theory, material culture, science studies, and visual culture. Interdisciplinary fields – particularly cultural studies – perform an important role in diffusing paradigms across disciplinary boundaries. Free‐floating paradigms are associated with the work of major theorists, such as Lévi‐Strauss, Barthes, Foucault, Bourdieu, Lyotard, Baudrillard, Clifford Geertz, Bruno Latour, Adorno, Gramsci, and Habermas.",sociology

From an interview study, the differentiation and limits of trust are analysed within different types of social relations. Trust is found to vary greatly in scope and mode influenced by the intersecting dimensions of relations, objects and situations. Furthermore, trust exists between an outer threshold of expected deceit and an inner threshold of confident reliance.

The main question that was considered to be of real sociological interest concerned the transformation of ‘little savages’ into civilized, reliable social actors, into adult actors, namely socialization. In contrast, the new sociological view of children fosters the study of a variety of children’s issues, addressing questions which are overlooked, excluded, marginalized or rendered illegitimate by the focus on socialization. Some important starting points and the central concepts of the ‘new’ childhood sociology — as it is often characterized by its proponents — are outlined. The development and ‘state of the art’ of this sociological field in different countries needs to be compared and reflected against the background of everyday assumptions and social problems in each of the respective societies in order to foster the further production of sociologically relevant knowledge — this constituted the programmatic approach of the articles assembled here.",sociology

Sociologists working to illuminate the causes and contours of these inequities often center the role of family foodwork, or the multifaceted domestic labor that supports eating, including planning and preparing meals. Mounting sociological scholarship on foodwork considers how food's meanings are socially patterned to reflect broader social structures, ideologies and institutions that influence their manifestation and families' resources to enact them. Here, we present three core contributions from the sociology of foodwork that can advance essential transdisciplinary conversations around nutrition disparities as well as efforts to tackle these disparities. We lay out how (1) family foodwork is historically rooted in broader structures of capitalist exploitation and women's subordination, and today remains gendered through normative discourses equating “good” feeding with “good” mothering; (2) the moralization of foodwork is buttressed by an ideological context idealizing homecooked meals and lamenting foodwork's decline, and; (3) foodwork—and societal evaluations of it—are shaped and stratified by intersecting gendered, classed, and racial inequalities. After reviewing each contribution and its importance for addressing nutrition inequities, we conclude by advocating for a closer conversation across disciplines and highlighting important future directions for sociologists.",sociology

Binary logistic regression modeling shows that probability of vaccinating against seasonal influenza is higher when the participants trust the overall healthcare system [Odds Ratio = 1.36,

Results suggest that trust in the family physicians is built through personal experiences with them which can be easily adjusted in contrast with overall trust in the healthcare system.

Yet, it remains a semantically ambiguous polyseme that has been understood and operationalized in often divergent ways by sociologists. In this essay, we survey contemporary empirical research on cultural tastes and use retroductive reasoning from measurements of taste to clarify the semantic ambiguity surrounding taste. We argue that taste should be conceptualized as a person’s thick subjectivity in a cultural field, that is to say a fundamentally multidimensional orientation that describes how we feel, consume, and praise in cultural fields. Recognizing the inherent multidimensionality to taste allows us to refine our understanding of complex taste phenomena. We outline a family of complex tastes using characteristic antinomies among their constituent modalities of action, and use a case study to show how each variety corresponds to extant folk concepts about taste.",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0220,"<p>One of the most pressing challenges of single-parent families is the concern for their socioeconomic well-being. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than two-parent families, and there is growing concern about the rising inequality among family types. Much research has focused on how children fare in single-parent families and whether or not they are at a disadvantage. However, concerns are not limited to children living in single-parent families, but also to single parents themselves. Single parenthood is strongly gendered: single parents are mostly mothers, and they therefore experience unequal opportunities and gender discrimination in the labor market. This bibliography addresses the key issues and debates related to single-parent families. Rather than promoting a single argument, it introduces the reader to a number of different perspectives, without taking a position on one perspective over the other. As the single-parent literature is broad and expanding rapidly, it is difficult to cover all aspects of single parenthood. Instead, this bibliography focuses on single-parent families in context. It covers how individual characteristics of single parents, such as their resources and education, shape aspects of their well-being. Yet the main focus is on how their well-being is also shaped by their socioeconomic and institutional context. How do employment and policy affect the lives of single parents and their children? The bibliography uses a comparative focus to examine the research on single-parent families across countries. Hence, it does not include all publications that address single parenthood, such as the social psychological aspects, but rather it examines the literature that best captures how single parents are doing in the context of the institutions and policies that surround them. This bibliography on “Single Parents in Context” is structured in six major sections. First, a broad overview of the literature is provided in the section on General Contributions This covers what can be considered Classics in the literature, and prior Research Overviews. The second section deals with aspects of the Socioeconomic Well-Being of single parents and their families, including Poverty, Child Well-Being, and Stigma. The next major sections (a substantial part of the bibliography) cover explanations for the often impaired well-being among single-parent families. These sections include resource-based, employment-based, and policy-based explanations. Resource-Based Explanations focus on individual characteristics of the single parents themselves, and include the debate regarding the important Diverging Destinies and Life-Course Perspective. Diverging Destinies suggests that single-parent families are increasingly common among those with lower socioeconomic resources, such as education. Life-Course Perspective discusses the dynamic process of single parenthood over the life course, such as transitions into and out of single parenthood. Employment-Based Explanations examine to what extent, and under which conditions, a job can be a means to improve single parents’ well-being. Employment is indeed important, because in some contexts single parents are employed but remain in poverty—considered the Working Poor. Additionally, single parents face particular challenges in terms of Work-Life Balance and negotiating the demands of work and family. Most importantly, this bibliography covers a wide range of policies and emphasizes various Policy-Based Explanations. Family Policy facilitates maternal employment and, increasingly, paternal care, as well as providing financial transfers to families with children. Active Labor Market Policy represents those policies that are often in the form of services, such as job placement and training. Such policy seeks to facilitate the employment of the inactive and unemployed. Redistributive Policy typically provides income transfers to help families financially sustain themselves. This is support from the social safety net in the form of cash assistance such as housing, food, and child benefit. Naturally, there is overlap between policy types, but family policy for families with children warrants a specific focus. There is also a focus on Child Support, which is a set of policies that regulates financial transfers among households of separated parents. This is followed by Policy Debates, a discussion that emphasizes the key debates around the design and implementation of policy for single-parent families. The final major section, Research Frontiers, lays out the frontiers in single-parent research. It highlights the potential major challenges and opportunities for research in years to come. These areas include Shared Parenting, Methodological Innovations, and Global Perspectives on what works for single parents and their families.</p>",sociology

This line of argument ushered the rising consensus across the social sciences that the prime causal role belongs to institutions.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0257,"<p>Ethnic enclaves have been defined in numerous ways. The word “ethnic” is often used to refer to a particular group with a shared nationality or cultural background. Enclaves sometimes refer to the concentration of ethnic groups within a geographic area. Academic inquiry of ethnic enclaves began with Kenneth Wilson and Alejandro Portes’s study of the “immigrant enclave” formed by Cubans in Miami, which they define as a concentration of ethnic businesses employing people from the same ethnic group. Researchers have tested, expanded, and modified the “enclave hypothesis”—ethnic concentration having a protective effect against a generally hostile climate facing immigrants and ethnic minorities. Depending on the author an enclave may refer to the geographic concentration of migrants and coethnics in a neighborhood; a place with social and economic structures that diverge from those in the surrounding area; or a concentration of economic activity, particularly businesses owned and staffed by members of a single ethnic group. In the strictest sense, ethnic enclaves are made up of a high concentration of an ethnic group within a geographic space, including a large number of business owners from that community. There have been examples throughout US history of ethnic enclaves, including Cubans in Miami, New York’s Chinatown, Japanese and Korean enclaves in California, and Jewish communities in Manhattan. There are also immigrant enclaves across the world. The protective effects of enclaves are largely related to the concentration of economic power to support social, cultural, and political development for immigrant communities committed to sustaining community life within the country where an enclave is formed. Many researchers have used a partial definition of ethnic enclaves only in terms of residential concentration. From this point of view, the existing evidence shows mixed effects for living in an enclave depending on the context, aspects of the enclave studied, and relative outcomes of interest. When applied and compared, the similarities between enclaves and other community formations, such as barrios and ghettos, become relevant. Segregation most frequently serves dominant groups who use isolation to disproportionately apportion resources and exploit marginalized workers. Yet, as Cathy Yang Liu has shown, a concentration of opportunities can lead to strong social and cultural networks within ethnic enclaves. Researchers using the concept of ethnic enclaves can benefit from considering the multilayered factors of immigration, ethnic difference, urban environments, economic systems, health, and power differentials between and among residents in ethnic enclave communities and beyond.</p>",sociology

The chapter explores the decisive impacts of welfare states on the circumstances of ageing, and their connections with the social distribution of family and caring roles. It continues to a discussion of generational and gender relations before examining wider environments for life-course development and their connections with familial and other forms of mutual care.

This reframing of waste is only achievable by engaging with various publics in ways that illuminate the relations between waste and wider societal issues concerned with over-production and over-consumption, poverty, racism, sexism and social justice.

10.1525/cs.2022.57379,"The Bristol School of Multiculturalism is a political theory/sociology interdisciplinary approach to its subject matter, which has been described as a form of normative sociology. It is normative in the way that a lot of critical social theory (e.g., Foucauldian) is not and is not merely “deconstructive” but also a constructive engagement with the concerns of co-citizens. It, however, eschews the abstract, top-down universalism of Rawlsian liberal egalitarianism in favour of a context of national citizenship and pays particular attention to bottom-up political struggle. However, unlike some other activist-oriented perspectives or standpoints, it is neither antistate nor antinational but is guided by a sense of inclusive unity or the common good. Essential to this unity is “recognition” and institutional, not merely symbolic, accommodation of minorities and a perspective on the “multi” which goes beyond the black-white binary and a secularist exclusion of political claims-making by religious and ethnoreligious groups such as Muslims in western Europe. Critically, the Bristol School of Multiculturalism is not just normative in that it does normative sociology, but most importantly, it engages in political theory to justify its normative perspective against objections and rival normative positions. So, the Bristol School of Multiculturalism is perhaps not just a normative sociology but also a form of normative sociological theory.",sociology

It is, therefore, an appropriate starting point for a discussion of the relationship between history and sociology in Britain. The ferment affected different branches of history in different ways: political and diplomatic history hardly at all; social and economic history much more. The impact of the social sciences on economic history came primarily from neo-classical economic theory allied to econometrics. Historians looked to the social sciences in the 1960s and 1970s for concepts, theories, and methods which would assist them to reinvigorate the writing of history. There can be little doubt that economic history was much more influenced between 1960 and 1990 by economics than was social history by sociology.

While recently much of this work has been dismissed, the appearance of more radical social movements and the ongoing crisis of neoliberalism suggest that it still has much to tell us. In this respect, this article seeks to readdress the writing of the historian E. P. Thompson, arguing that his work on the class-based and other social movements, poetics, critique of positivism and economic reason, utopia and the idea of the commons all have much to offer more contemporary scholarship. While the article recognises that the cultural Marxism of figures like Thompson cannot simply be resurrected, it does continue to offer a number of critical insights. By readdressing the internal complexity of Thompson’s writing, the argumentative strategy of this article suggests that cultural sociology needs to move beyond more simplistic understandings of cultural Marxism and more carefully explore what it has to offer. This is especially pressing in a world that after the financial crash of 2008 has become increasingly dominated by the values and practices of capitalism. In this respect, Thompson’s contribution to cultural sociology is to offer a more complex language of resistance and transformation than exists within other less class-based traditions of sociology.",sociology

Rather, it arises from the enduring residualism of Australian sociology vis-a-vis economics. In turn, this residualism is grounded in sociology's late beginnings in Australia, the dominant framework at the time of its insititutionalization in the 1950s and 1960s, and the limited challenge presented by critical approaches from the 1970s. The article identifies four major lines of inquiry in the resurgence of economic sociology: network analysis, comparative political economy, field theory and performativity theory.

Yet, as demonstrated in Gabriel Abend’s 2008 article ‘The Meaning of ‘Theory’, it is generally unclear what sociologists mean when they talk about theory. Abend distinguishes seven different meanings sociologists tend to impute to ‘theory’ and argues that no single definition can usefully capture these substantively different meanings. Counter to Abend, we propose and defend a minimal and versatile theory of theory, which does capture the important common denominators in sociologists' various uses of the term theory. The major strengths of our proposal are that it enables informed and synthetic discussion and fosters reflexivity about differences and similarities between different types of theory.

This paper develops an analysis of the ways objects of knowledge are translated into other media, in order to understand the visual practices of sociology and to point out unused possibilities. I argue that the discourse on visual sociology, by assuming that photographs are less objective than text, is based on an asymmetric media‐determinism and on a misleading notion of objectivity. Instead, I suggest to analyse media with the concept of translations. I introduce several kinds of translations, most centrally the distinction between tight and loose ones. I show that many sciences, such as biology, focus on tight translations, using a variety of media and manipulating both research objects and representations. Sociology, in contrast, uses both tight and loose translations, but uses the latter only for texts. For visuals, sociology restricts itself to what I call ‘the documentary’: focusing on mechanical recording technologies without manipulating either the object of research or the representation. I conclude by discussing three rare examples of what is largely excluded in sociology: visual loose translations, visual tight translations based on non‐mechanical recording technologies, and visual tight translations based on mechanical recording technologies that include the manipulation of both object and representation.",sociology

In contrast to modernist portrayals of postmodernity as a period in a unilinear progression, the latter needs to be understood as the other within modernity that cannot be reduced to the same.

Third, aging research uses the full repertoire of methods that characterize the discipline, including life tables and other demographic methods, survey research, ethnographic methods, and observational studies. The depth of the field results from the accumulation of scientific studies that now span more than three‐quarters of a century.",sociology

The sociology of work, then, involves the systematic study of the interrelationship between the people and institutions associated with the production of goods and services. The general heading of the sociology of work subsumes many topics, which can be separated roughly into individual‐level approaches and structural‐level approaches. Individual‐level approaches treat the individual as the unit of analysis and typically focus on ascribed characteristics such as gender, race, and age. They also commonly address achieved characteristics such as education, promotion, compensation, and other labor force outcomes. Individual‐level approaches may also examine the impact of work over time by looking at the life course or career trajectory of individuals.",sociology

These applications were quite different from traditional data analysis wherein statistical procedures are the main tools. The idea was to create more rigorous scientific theories than had hitherto existed in these fields. Traditionally, for instance, theories in fields such as psychology and sociology were strong in intuitive content, but weak from a formal point of view. That is, assumptions and definitions were not clearly stipulated and distinguished from factual descriptions and inferences. In particular, there was rarely a formal deduction of a conclusion from specified premises.",sociology

I created it after having conversations with other Asian women about how we are constantly trying to speak out against systemic violence in organizations that claim to be anti-oppressive, and yet, are almost entirely made up of white folx at the managerial level. Our words momentarily capture attention – perhaps people are shocked at the assertiveness and articulateness of Asian women who are stereotyped as passive and politically apathetic – and we receive acknowledgement, apologies, and offers of help. But over time, we realize that not only has no meaningful change been made, but that we are now no longer invited to the table for discussions. The polite responses always drown out the calls for change, or the offers of help are conditional, requiring us to conform to a white middleclass standard of social respectability that erases our very ways of being and the agency of choice. At the same time, my conversations with friends remind me that we can still draw on each other for strengths, inspirations, and creative strategies to persist in our various spaces; to find small ways of resistance against what bell hook (1995) calls “white supremacist capitalist patriarchy” (p. 17); to continue to keep alive the dream of a less violent future.",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0220,"<p>One of the most pressing challenges of single-parent families is the concern for their socioeconomic well-being. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than two-parent families, and there is growing concern about the rising inequality among family types. Much research has focused on how children fare in single-parent families and whether or not they are at a disadvantage. However, concerns are not limited to children living in single-parent families, but also to single parents themselves. Single parenthood is strongly gendered: single parents are mostly mothers, and they therefore experience unequal opportunities and gender discrimination in the labor market. This bibliography addresses the key issues and debates related to single-parent families. Rather than promoting a single argument, it introduces the reader to a number of different perspectives, without taking a position on one perspective over the other. As the single-parent literature is broad and expanding rapidly, it is difficult to cover all aspects of single parenthood. Instead, this bibliography focuses on single-parent families in context. It covers how individual characteristics of single parents, such as their resources and education, shape aspects of their well-being. Yet the main focus is on how their well-being is also shaped by their socioeconomic and institutional context. How do employment and policy affect the lives of single parents and their children? The bibliography uses a comparative focus to examine the research on single-parent families across countries. Hence, it does not include all publications that address single parenthood, such as the social psychological aspects, but rather it examines the literature that best captures how single parents are doing in the context of the institutions and policies that surround them. This bibliography on “Single Parents in Context” is structured in six major sections. First, a broad overview of the literature is provided in the section on General Contributions This covers what can be considered Classics in the literature, and prior Research Overviews. The second section deals with aspects of the Socioeconomic Well-Being of single parents and their families, including Poverty, Child Well-Being, and Stigma. The next major sections (a substantial part of the bibliography) cover explanations for the often impaired well-being among single-parent families. These sections include resource-based, employment-based, and policy-based explanations. Resource-Based Explanations focus on individual characteristics of the single parents themselves, and include the debate regarding the important Diverging Destinies and Life-Course Perspective. Diverging Destinies suggests that single-parent families are increasingly common among those with lower socioeconomic resources, such as education. Life-Course Perspective discusses the dynamic process of single parenthood over the life course, such as transitions into and out of single parenthood. Employment-Based Explanations examine to what extent, and under which conditions, a job can be a means to improve single parents’ well-being. Employment is indeed important, because in some contexts single parents are employed but remain in poverty—considered the Working Poor. Additionally, single parents face particular challenges in terms of Work-Life Balance and negotiating the demands of work and family. Most importantly, this bibliography covers a wide range of policies and emphasizes various Policy-Based Explanations. Family Policy facilitates maternal employment and, increasingly, paternal care, as well as providing financial transfers to families with children. Active Labor Market Policy represents those policies that are often in the form of services, such as job placement and training. Such policy seeks to facilitate the employment of the inactive and unemployed. Redistributive Policy typically provides income transfers to help families financially sustain themselves. This is support from the social safety net in the form of cash assistance such as housing, food, and child benefit. Naturally, there is overlap between policy types, but family policy for families with children warrants a specific focus. There is also a focus on Child Support, which is a set of policies that regulates financial transfers among households of separated parents. This is followed by Policy Debates, a discussion that emphasizes the key debates around the design and implementation of policy for single-parent families. The final major section, Research Frontiers, lays out the frontiers in single-parent research. It highlights the potential major challenges and opportunities for research in years to come. These areas include Shared Parenting, Methodological Innovations, and Global Perspectives on what works for single parents and their families.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0257,"<p>Ethnic enclaves have been defined in numerous ways. The word “ethnic” is often used to refer to a particular group with a shared nationality or cultural background. Enclaves sometimes refer to the concentration of ethnic groups within a geographic area. Academic inquiry of ethnic enclaves began with Kenneth Wilson and Alejandro Portes’s study of the “immigrant enclave” formed by Cubans in Miami, which they define as a concentration of ethnic businesses employing people from the same ethnic group. Researchers have tested, expanded, and modified the “enclave hypothesis”—ethnic concentration having a protective effect against a generally hostile climate facing immigrants and ethnic minorities. Depending on the author an enclave may refer to the geographic concentration of migrants and coethnics in a neighborhood; a place with social and economic structures that diverge from those in the surrounding area; or a concentration of economic activity, particularly businesses owned and staffed by members of a single ethnic group. In the strictest sense, ethnic enclaves are made up of a high concentration of an ethnic group within a geographic space, including a large number of business owners from that community. There have been examples throughout US history of ethnic enclaves, including Cubans in Miami, New York’s Chinatown, Japanese and Korean enclaves in California, and Jewish communities in Manhattan. There are also immigrant enclaves across the world. The protective effects of enclaves are largely related to the concentration of economic power to support social, cultural, and political development for immigrant communities committed to sustaining community life within the country where an enclave is formed. Many researchers have used a partial definition of ethnic enclaves only in terms of residential concentration. From this point of view, the existing evidence shows mixed effects for living in an enclave depending on the context, aspects of the enclave studied, and relative outcomes of interest. When applied and compared, the similarities between enclaves and other community formations, such as barrios and ghettos, become relevant. Segregation most frequently serves dominant groups who use isolation to disproportionately apportion resources and exploit marginalized workers. Yet, as Cathy Yang Liu has shown, a concentration of opportunities can lead to strong social and cultural networks within ethnic enclaves. Researchers using the concept of ethnic enclaves can benefit from considering the multilayered factors of immigration, ethnic difference, urban environments, economic systems, health, and power differentials between and among residents in ethnic enclave communities and beyond.</p>",sociology

As is the case with many disciplines, it is contested and there is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes sociology. As a social science, sociology can be described as evidence‐based social inquiry into the social world and informed by conceptual frameworks and established methodological approaches. Sociology is the only science specifically devoted to the study of society in the broad sense of the term, meaning the social world and the open field of the social. Like many of the social and human sciences it does not have a clearly defined subject matter. Sociology is a versatile and resilient discipline that takes many forms. One of its enduring characteristics is that it brings to bear on the study of the social world a general perspective born of the recognition that the sum is greater than the parts.",sociology

The name comes from Elias's use of the grounding concept of “figuration” as a deliberate attempt to bypass and reformulate the speech and thought parameters of what he saw as homo clausus (“closed person”) assumptions underlying much of sociology. Figurational sociologists reject such common notions as agency–structure, action–structure, or “individual” and “society,” all of which imply that “the individual” is something separate and isolated from “society.” They think instead in terms of figurations or complex webs of interdependent relationships between people (homines aperti, or “open people”). These complex webs of interdependence are always in a state of flux, hence the alternative title of “process sociology” preferred by many researchers working within this tradition. Figurational dynamics can be seen in the longer and shorter term and might include state formation processes, civilizing and decivilizing processes, or the deamateurization of sport amongst many others.",sociology

It is an expression of the emotional and social manifestations of living between two countries and experiencing the loss of time with family and friends. It is an expression of the yearning for social connections that I left behind. It is also an attempt to reconcile with the experiences of forced migration and distance, which are not always successful.
 
I used to visit Kuwait annually, but when COVID-19 hit, it interrupted these frequent visits. Up until recently, I had not visited in four years. But I stayed connected with my family and friends virtually, though WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Zoom. When I finally went this winter, I was filled with overwhelming emotions. It had been too long, and I felt as though things have changed. But it was really me who has. Being away for such a long time has created a gap that I am still trying to understand. I was never troubled by distance. In fact, I loved it because it gave me the space to learn more about myself and explore the world. I thought I was okay with the distance for the longest time. But I learned how much I was craving the warmth of close connections, the in-person quality time, the long night chats, the morning coffees, the brunches by the beach, and the hugs I received from loved ones. I leaned that this distance meant missing out on making memories with loved ones. And losing so much time that can never be regained. 
 
I realized that when I was glued to my phone every day for hours, it was because I wanted to stay connected, and not be forgotten because distance can do that. I have already felt so many friendships fade away because of the distance, and now I find myself trying to hold on to those I have left. Yes, I made new ones virtually. And I had the chance to meet them in person this time. And it was beautiful. But now, I am leaving, again. I am more now of how this distance impacts me, and my relations. This time, I was very sad to leave. 
 
I wasn’t ready to leave just yet. I did not get enough time to be with my loved ones. It was a month, but it felt so short. I tried to squeeze all the meetings, squeeze all the love I craved, but it was so much love that just didn’t fit in such a short time. I had to leave eventually, again, with a big part of my heart left behind. A big part of my life away from me. And no matter what I do to stay connected, it’s not the same. I realized now, no matter what I choose, where I choose to live, I cannot have it all. And that I will always be giving up something. Oh the luxury to have it all…",sociology

These writings compare closely with Karl Jaspers's existentialist conception of transcendence and `limit-experience' from the same period and also particularly with the later philosophical writings of Georg Simmel on the concept of life and the meaning of absolute value orientations from the standpoint of historical immanence. This distinctive conception of `immanent transcendence' — first named as such by Simmel and later reaffirmed by Alfred Weber — is explored in this article in relation to a range of questions about the normative import of theological figures of thought and language for the formation of modern social-scientific thinking and reasoning. The claim is defended that Alfred Weber's oeuvre should remain of interest to contemporary social theorists, despite its many weaknesses and frequent moments of obscurity.",sociology

Upon closer examination, it is apparent that Durkheim and the Chicago school share a great deal more points of connection than are commonly acknowledged. These similarities have been blurred due to (1) a lack of distinction between the later, qualitatively focused Chicago school of sociology researchers with the more quantitatively-based work of the original school and (2) a pervasive misunderstanding of what Durkheim meant by treating a ‘social fact’ as a thing. A more accurate account reveals that the two research traditions are both heavily empirical, pragmatic, contextually based approaches to studying non-individualized, collective behavior.

It indicates the intellectual influences of the early years that Bourdieu subsequently acknowledged and then examines his use of the work of Weber in his first book, Sociologie de l’Algérie (1958). The paper then focuses on the development of Bourdieu’s thought from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, a period in which he strategically presented himself as an anti-humanist sociologist whilst also articulating a view of science that was in tune with phenomenological and ontological philosophy. Bourdieu’s ‘Sociology and Philosophy in France since 1945’ (1967a) receives particular attention since his analysis of sociology and philosophy in France in the post-war period was a key element in his own position-taking in respect of the two disciplines. The paper then examines Bourdieu’s critiques of Weber at this time and suggests that his dissatisfaction with Weber’s epistemology logically became a dissastisfaction with the claims of sociological explanation as such. There followed an attempt to reconcile a commitment to social science with an allegiance to elements of phenomenological thought. The outcome was a willingness on Bourdieu’s part to see reflexivity as a means to problematiz- ing sociological explanation more than as a means to refining it or making it more sophisticated. The consequence was that commitments to phenomenological ontology and social science co-existed in this period. The balance was to change again subsequently in Bourdieu’s thought, and his responsivenesss to changing conditions exemplifies how we should ourselves rethink the relations between possible future social theories and the classical theories of Western sociology.",sociology

The review focuses in detail on empirical research on the social and cultural aspects of transportation. The study of transport in daily life, or the study of mobile cultures, is reviewed with a particular attention to issues of time and space, as well as the social problems and social inequalities generated by dominant patterns of mobility. It also discusses the mobility turn in sociology and the growth of a new mobility paradigm influencing important shifts in sociological theory and research methodology. It defines the field of mobilities as the study of the social aspects of movement, including the movement of people, material objects, information, and capital – both in the material and the virtual sense. Mobilities for instance may include phenomena as migration, transport, travel and tourism, wireless and portable communication technology use, the social organization of transportation and communication infrastructures, and regional and transnational flows of capital and material things.",sociology

During the first period (1856–1910), sociology and positivism acquired exceptional relevance as an intellectual and governmental discourse to legitimize science, the separation of church and state, and the importance of secular and free education. The second part deals with the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), the revolt against positivism, and the search of a new national identity through cultural expression and a new interest in anthropology over sociology.",sociology

Still, old habits die hard. Focusing on selected texts in the sociology of the Australian family, this paper traces the effects of failing to focus the sociological gaze on subjectivity and its variation across society. Highlighted are some patterns of analytic misconstruction of subjectivity, especially the substitution of measurement for a theory of practice, and the projection by sociologists of their own class‐specific subjectivity onto society at large. Ultimately, this misconstruction turns works like those discussed in this paper into a powerful denial of alternative subjectivities, and a reinforcement of the socially dominant perspective.",sociology

The fact that these changes occurred in many western countries but led to legalisation in only a few makes this claim problematic. I examine whether socio‐legal propositions, with respect to the emergence of laws which focus on social control, offer a better approach to understanding the development of rules allowing and governing euthanasia. After a short sketch of the history of the Dutch law regulating euthanasia, I discuss these three societal changes in the light of shifts in the social control of medical behaviour that shortens life. I show that the Dutch relaxation of the prohibition of euthanasia goes together with new forms of social control: doctors’ self control is complemented with second‐party control (by patients), professional third‐party control and governmental control. My work calls attention to the fact that bioethics is part of larger systems of social control.",sociology

Castells in the framework of a discursive analysis of the possibilities of their use in the further institutionalization of digital sociology, as a relatively autonomous set of scientific data of sociology. The author considers literary sources related to the scientific work of M. Castells, methodological tools of discursive analysis and databases. The paper describes theoretical approaches to the study of the concept of the power of communication in ontological and socio-cultural contexts, as well as the characteristics of the author’s empirical sociological research in the framework of disclosing the logical and semantic components of the concept under consideration. Based on the discursive analysis, the author reveals structural, functional, procedural, organizational and managerial components of the theoretical views of the scientist, which help to clarify the object-subject sphere and the methodological arsenal of sociological research in the field of information and communication network “Internet”. The article considers the scientific approaches of the scientist to clarify the concept of “power” by explaining the role and place of actors in it, as well as use by them of social networks for their influence. The author highlights separately the scientist`s disclosure of the “network society” concept, which determines the network structure of connections based on the activation of information. The paper describes the features of the scientific method of M. Castells, associated with the postulation of the thesis of the regularity of the continuous replacement of scientific concepts in the knowledge of power relations and communications, the importance of flexibility and changing the angle of view of the scientist to solve specific research problems. The author emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the scientific methodology, method and socio-project approaches of the scientist. The study gives the directions of implementation of scientific developments of M. Castells in digital sociology, substantiates socio-project ways of increasing the positive potential of Internet communications in the context of digital society development.<jats:bold />",sociology
10.1177/0011392110385969,"This article argues that Norwegian public health nurses, after a long period of professionalization, have recently undergone a process of deprofessionalization. Public health nurses’ jurisdiction has become heavily circumscribed. They have lost duties linked with power and respect in the local community and they have lost monopoly on duties originally ascribed to the profession. Despite these changes, this study indicates a conspicuous lack of open disputes, conflicts or demands centred on jurisdiction and jurisdictional claims. In other words, the manner in which public health nurses cope with recent changes in their job structure does not seem to follow an easily explainable pattern in terms of prevailing sociological theories on professions. It is argued that the sociology of professions needs to develop theories that can explain why deprofessionalization sometimes occurs without resistance.",sociology
10.1177/026858089004002002,"Bourdieu describes the structure of society as a result of class conflicts and status competition. Art in general, and the literary field in particular, is interpreted as a differentiated social field that is autonomous in the sense that it follows its own logic - the competition for cultural legitimation. What literature has in common with other social systems is the stratification of its internal structure into a hierarchical arrangement. Thus the literary field can be described as a horizontally differentiated system that is, however, vertically differentiated internally.  The concern of the paper is to test Bourdieu's theoretical considerations empirically. Data for the analysis and interpretation are based on interviews of Cologne writers. The data are analysed with the aid of blockmodel and correspondence analysis. As far as the data allows us to operationalise the thesis that the literary field is an autonomous differentiated system, Bourdieu's thesis is confirmed. The internal structure can be described more precisely: the first line of demarcation is, in fact, the difference that Bourdieu described between legitimate and illegitimate art: high-culture literature and low-culture literature are the two poles of the literary field. The realm of the legitimate literature is further differentiated into three blocks (elite, junior elite, periphery). The elite and the periphery differ in terms of the different degrees of success. The junior elite occupies an intermediate place. Bourdieu's sociology of literature is supported by the empirical material at hand.",sociology

The inaugural lecture, in particular, is largely ignored by sociologists. It is shown in the present article that the 1895 lecture is in fact an absolutely necessary key to the proper appreciation of Weber's subsequent work. Indeed, a reading of Weber's later writings through the prism of the inaugural lecture provides new, challenging and corrective understandings of Weber's argument and meaning. In a discussion of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and Weber's methodological essays, two things are shown. First, that the continuities between the 1895 lecture and the subsequent works are strong and readily demonstrable. Second, that an appreciation of Weber's argument in the inaugural lecture transforms the conventional understandings of the later works.",sociology
10.1177/1468795x13491647,"Existing accounts of American sociology’s founding years during the early twentieth century assume that the discipline was ‘metrocentric.’ They assume that it was only interested in processes occurring within the United States; that American sociologists fell prey to state-centrist thought; and that, therefore, contextualizing America sociology’s emergence necessitates understanding relations, events, and processes within the confines of US territorial boundaries. By contrast, this paper shows the imperial and hence global aspects of early American sociological thought. Early American sociologists were interested in imperialism and, therefore, in cross-societal, transnational, and global processes and relations. Implicitly or explicitly they approached imperialism as a process by which social groups, not least ‘races,’ interacted and conflicted. They also saw it as a route towards new global forms. Early American sociology thus articulated a sociological imagination that looked beyond American society and to the wider world.",sociology

The contributions focus on both theoretical and empirical studies about care relations and their global interrelations. To shed light on the dynamics that characterise the social organisation of care and care work, the monograph has been structured around three significant tendencies in the international sociology of care: (a) the marketisation and the de-commodification of care and care work; (b) the transnationalisation of labour and policies; and (c) new forms of governance and social statehood.

10.1177/1440783311413489,"Sociologist Nicole Asquith argues that, in Australia, when it ‘comes to population ageing, sociology has been, in large part, silent in the face of neo-liberal policies of positive ageing’ (2009: 255). In the absence of such critical research, governments at all levels since the 1990s have pursued policies of ageing that tends to subordinate the social needs of older Australians to the nation’s economic needs. This paper seeks to explain why the critical social gerontology movement has not taken root in Australia through an historical analysis of ageing research in Australia. Furthermore, it aims to demonstrate the rewards of critical analysis through new research into the discourses of positive ageing. It also shows how older Australians resist ‘responsible’ ageing and its regulation of them. This analysis is designed to inspire further critical engagement, which recognizes the diversity of older Australians, giving voice to their resistance, and better inform policy development.",sociology

Exploring the future tense provides a means of taking responsibility for what is to come; yet, the movement of the social sciences into the tricky terrain of the future presents tensions.

This study utilizes a content analysis of 461 student-authored, end-of-semester reflective essays concerning the most memorable learning that occurred in an introductory sociology course. Collected between 2006 and 2015, the assignment was utilized in each of 12 introductory sociology course sections taught by the same instructor at two universities. We then map student essay topics onto the Sociological Literacy Framework (SLF) to identify the themes most memorable to students, comparing responses of online, regional campus students with residential campus students. Results suggest the instructor placed the greatest emphasis on the SLF Sociological Eye theme and the least emphasis on the SLF Social Change and Reproduction theme. Students found topics within the SLF Socialization theme most memorable and rarely cited the SLF Social Change and Reproduction theme.",sociology

10.1177/17499755211048435,"This article offers a regional spotlight introduction to Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology. The question of what makes Canada unique has long preoccupied Canadian writers, artists, and policy makers, and is central to scholarly debates about Canadian sociology’s position relative to British, American, and other national sociologies, as well as the need for decolonization and diversification of the disciplinary canon. As a subfield, Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology receives little attention within these wider debates despite its emphasis on issues of cultural difference, identity, and evaluation. We provide an analysis of the dynamics of the field. Using course syllabi and survey data from instructors (N = 28), we examine whether there is a unique canon in Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology, and how cultural sociology is taught across Canada. Network analysis of texts assigned on syllabi and survey responses from cultural sociology instructors reveal, first, a thematic canon in Canadian cultural sociology, with a plurality of authors used to teach four main themes: identity and representation, cultural production, cultural consumption, and conceptualizing and measuring culture. Second, we find the positionality of Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology (with respect to both other national sociologies and neighboring subfields/disciplines) is uncertain and widely variant. Finally, survey responses concerning identity and representation suggest a reflexivity about the politics of canonization, and a gendered interest in decolonizing curricula. We conclude by arguing that a thematic canon in cultural sociology facilitates the maintenance of fuzzy boundaries with other subfields, national and Indigenous intellectual traditions, and a critical feminist lens.",sociology

It thus aims to contribute to filling the theoretical lacunae in the current sociological approach to this fairly recent phenomenon. The article’s framework is divided into four segments. First, the rise in food allergies is placed within the field of the social history and medicalization of allergies, and seeks to understand the phenomenon in the context of the industrialized modern world. The following section discusses how and why lay experts are increasingly dominating the food allergy-related discourse. Drawing on recent empirical data, it is further shown how food allergies rise along with a population’s affluence and education. Third, the idiosyncrasies of food allergies and intolerances are addressed with respect to food consumption and its changing social implications. It is argued that individualization places less pressure on individuals to conform to broader social norms of food refusal, which offers the sufferers with a newly acquired sense of control over a random, scientified, and confounding food availability and provides a medium to covertly convey their educational and socioeconomic background. Lastly, the health belief model is applied in order to suggest a further potential explanation for the current increase in self-reported food allergies and intolerances.",sociology

Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk are concerned with the `pathos' of listening as a potential way of transcending social divisions.

Holmwood is correct that sociology is vulnerable to external pressures to demonstrate its relevance to social practice, but those pressures come from left‐wing social movements as well as from centres of power. He is also correct that external pressures contribute to internal disagreement, but sociology has been at war with itself since the 1960s, with little evident decline in its academic standing or intellectual vitality.

This is induced by the claims of rational choice theorists that extending this model from economics to sociology can be conducive to establishing a unifying paradigm and method to be given `paradigmatic privilege' within sociology. The outcome of such an extension of the economic approach has been `sociological rational choice theory' or `rational action theory for sociology'. Within sociology, such a rational choice model is regarded as a major theoretical or/and methodological innovation and thus a `new' promise for sociology's unification. Overall, the paper suggests that these `ecumenistic' claims of rational choice theorists cannot be taken at face value since they are predicated upon dubious views of the relations between economy and society and between economics and sociology, including inadequate interpretations of neoclassical economics.",sociology

To show that his approach can provide predictions he uses aggregate supply and demand curves to analyse the exchange of advice for compliance within a work group, and from this derives predictions about status differentiation. However, his use of aggregate supply and demand curves requires, first, that what is being exchanged should be additive; second, that actors should evaluate exchanges by universalistic criteria; and, third, that they should act atomistically. The third assumption seems implausible within a work group, but, if it is valid, it follows that predictions cannot be made about status. This is because status differentiation can be said to occur only when there is both social distance and differential esteem between actors, and because differential esteem is likely to arise only within solidary groups.",sociology

Competition with the demands of housewifery means that to the mother as houseworker, the child is sometimes seen as an obstacle to job satisfaction; for the child, the need to juxtapose its demands with those of housework cannot but be experienced as frustrating. Although men do something to remedy this difficulty by involving themselves in child-care, the trend could be seen as a retrogressive one from the women's point of view.

It provides a comprehensive analysis of how socioeconomic status, race, gender, culture, and other social determinants influence health behaviors, access to healthcare, and the experience of illness. The chapter also explores key concepts such as the social construction of illness, medicalization, and the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. Through comparative analysis, it examines different healthcare systems worldwide, the impact of globalization, and the role of international organizations in shaping global health policies. The discussion extends to emerging trends and challenges in the field, including digital health, mental health, and global health inequities. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research and interdisciplinary collaboration in medical sociology to inform public health policies and promote equitable healthcare systems.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0058,"<p>Recent years have seen a rapid growth in interest in the addition of a spatial perspective, especially in the social and health sciences, and in part this growth has been driven by the ready availability of georeferenced or geospatial data, and the tools to analyze them: geographic information science (GIS), spatial analysis, and spatial statistics. Indeed, research on race/ethnic segregation and other forms of social stratification as well as research on human health and behavior problems, such as obesity, mental health, risk-taking behaviors, and crime, depend on the collection and analysis of individual- and contextual-level (geographic area) data across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Given all of these considerations, researchers are continuously developing new ways to harness and analyze geo-referenced data. Indeed, a prerequisite for spatial analysis is the availability of information on locations (i.e., places) and the attributes of those locations (e.g., poverty rates, educational attainment, religious participation, or disease prevalence). This Oxford Bibliographies article has two main parts. First, following a general overview of spatial concepts and spatial thinking in sociology, we introduce the field of spatial analysis focusing on easily available textbooks (introductory, handbooks, and advanced), journals, data, and online instructional resources. The second half of this article provides an explicit focus on spatial approaches within specific areas of sociological inquiry, including crime, demography, education, health, inequality, and religion. This section is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to indicate how some concepts, measures, data, and methods have been used by sociologists, criminologists, and demographers during their research. Throughout all sections we have attempted to introduce classic articles as well as contemporary studies. Spatial analysis is a general term to describe an array of statistical techniques that utilize locational information to better understand the pattern of observed attribute values and the processes that generated the observed pattern. The best-known early example of spatial analysis is John Snow’s 1854 cholera map of London, but the origins of spatial analysis can be traced back to France during the 1820s and 1830s and the period of morale statistique, specifically the work of Guerry, d’Angeville, Duplin, and Quetelet. The foundation for current spatial statistical analysis practice is built on methodological development in both statistics and ecology during the 1950s and quantitative geography during the 1960s and 1970s and it is a field that has been greatly enhanced by improvements in computer and information technologies relevant to the collection, and visualization and analysis of geographic or geospatial data. In the early 21st century, four main methodological approaches to spatial analysis can be identified in the literature: exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), spatial statistics, spatial econometrics, and geostatistics. The diversity of spatial-analytical methods available to researchers is wide and growing, which is also a function of the different types of analytical units and data types used in formal spatial analysis—specifically, point data (e.g., crime events, disease cases), line data (e.g., networks, routes), spatial continuous or field data (e.g., accessibility surfaces), and area or lattice data (e.g., unemployment and mortality rates). Applications of geospatial data and/or spatial analysis are increasingly found in sociological research, especially in studies of spatial inequality, residential segregation, demography, education, religion, neighborhoods and health, and criminology.</p>",sociology

Research within the disciplines of psychiatry and criminology has increasingly identified a link between ADHD, delinquency and crime. So far, consideration of ADHD from sociological perspectives has been limited, while it has been virtually ignored as a diagnosis with social impact and a popular phenomenon within Australia. In response, this article draws on conceptual resources from the sociology of deviance to illustrate the value of sociological perspectives and to explore questions about the impact of ADHD that psycho-medical perspectives cannot. In doing so, the article adds to existing understandings of the social aspects of this prominent disorder and aims to encourage the development of new conceptualisations that lie beyond the existing deficit label.",sociology

The article indicates ways in which various studies have proved highly influential and continue to form the basis for research, policy and practice. Sociological concepts such as stigma continue to resonate as they highlight the sense in which negative social attitudes often make life harder for those who are already experiencing distress. The politics of risk in mental health, which has become a particularly powerful force in recent years, has made the prevailing climate more and not less stigmatising for those identified with ‘mental illness’. The article concludes by arguing that the sociology of mental health continues to offer the conceptual and theoretical foundation from which negative associations can be challenged and overturned.",sociology

There was something of a reception of Ibn Khaldun in Europe at that time by sociologists and other scholars who were not necessarily involved with Islamic or West Asian studies. In fact, the reception of Ibn Khaldun by modern scholars in the West can be differentiated into Eurocentric or Orientalist as opposed to more disciplinary attitudes. While much has been said about the Eurocentric reception of Ibn Khaldun, less is discussed about the disciplinary approach to Ibn Khaldun among thinkers who wrote when the modern science of sociology was emerging in Europe. This special issue on Ibn Khaldun in the Formative Period of Sociology provides English translations of six articles originally written in Italian, French, German, Polish, Spanish and Turkish between 1896 and 1934. Not all of these articles were written by sociologists. Together, they provide some background as to how Ibn Khaldun was conceived of in non‐area studies circles, in the social sciences and humanities.",sociology

I consider these contributions and advocate for an interdisciplinary research agenda that continues expanding relational scholarship by developing the concept of the politics of erased migrations, an analytical tool to theorize why and how the embodied experiences of Latinas are marginalized and misrepresented in academic research. Latinas experience various physical and symbolic migrations—across and within national borders, social and political contexts, identities, academic disciplines, methodologies, and social movements. Yet Latina feminist experiences, knowledge, and political movement largely remain at the margins of these borders. Through a review of prominent research on gender and migration centered on heteronormativity, reproduction, and the nation‐state, I demonstrate the possibilities of the politics of erased migration as a theoretical intervention in expanding a relational, intersectional sociology of Latinx gender and migration. This paper carries implications for shifting the field of Latinx gender and migration from a focus on current oppressive conditions to one that also imagines new avenues for social justice and alternative social worlds.",sociology

These discourses have been reignited in recent years by changes in the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicalised cosmetic procedures. The most popular of these procedures are non‐surgical ‘tweakments’ to the shape and/or appearance of the face, usually through use of ‘injectables’ such as Botox and dermal fillers. This shift in focus from surgical procedures to minimally invasive injections has led more practitioners to join the market of potential providers and a wider variety of consumers to seek them out. This has been accompanied by panic about the risks to bodies and aesthetic standards if stewardship of beauty should fall into the wrong hands. We trace the history of medicalised cosmetic practices and academic discourses on the body, particularly how cosmetic practices are understood to produce the body as gendered and racialised. We then suggest future approaches for exploring the sociological significance of new cosmetic practices. We encourage researchers to explore how imaginaries of (un)desirable bodies shape debates about appropriate use of non‐surgical cosmetic procedures, alongside investigation of the situated intersections of identity that are inscribed on bodies.",sociology

Second, this paper argues that the medicalization of childhood and the rise of the disease entity of ADHD stems from the transformation of children and childhood into objects of scientific study. Third, using the example of ADHD, this paper will attempt to demystify the premise that medicalization emanates from the “monolith” of medicine, but is instead, a process rife with internal contradiction and epistemological disagreement. Fourth, following the uncertainty of etiological positions toward childhood behavior problems, this paper will discuss some of the external critiques of medicalization, including the way that lay actors push back against the medicalization process, and concerns about the effectiveness of technologies used to diagnose and treat ADHD.",sociology

Despite its growing uneasiness about these facts, social science has not produced much theoretical innovation about them. This article aims to contribute to this task, by bringing to bear a conceptual framework elaborated by Shmuel N. Eisenstadt through his reflections on modern barbarism. I argue that the author’s understanding of barbarism has a significant interpretive potential for the sociological analysis of contemporary radical identities, and suggest some ways to reconsider ‘populism’, thereby redefining the very concept of radicalism. The article starts by introducing the pivotal notions which constitute the conceptual framework of our author. The following section outlines the main argument of Eisenstadt’s theory of barbarism, unpacking the way in which those concepts interweave to conjure a cultural theory of exclusionary, violent identities and institutional regimes.

His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the `networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory.

10.1177/1468795x231159618,"The main objective of the paper is to identify the logic of the sociological field in the GDR, looking at how it was spatialized in the city of East Berlin. In this regard, I am less interested in providing an overview of the different research streams of the main sociologists operating in the scientific and academic institutes located in Berlin than in reconstructing some crucial dynamics at work there and highlighting their effects at the social and symbolic levels. The underlying idea is that, especially in East Berlin, the sociological knowledge produced was less homogeneous than it has been represented in the existing literature. Without negating the existence of shared aspects characterizing Marxist-Leninist sociology, also superimposed on the political elite, a field analysis enables us to see how the different positions and trajectories of GDR-sociologists had an impact on their approaches to theoretical, epistemological, and methodological questions, and on their understanding and uses of concepts deriving from both Marxist-Leninist and “bourgeois” sociology. In the analysis, I will first compare the social trajectories of two of my interview-partners as paradigmatic of two different sociological habitus depending on their different academic/political socialization, networks, and positions in the field. As a second step, I will present a sketch of the sociological field drawn from 63 curricula of sociologists active in East Berlin in an attempt to pinpoint, on a larger scale, the homologies between the social and symbolic spaces of the field. Thus, the underlying idea is to examine the intersection of the “quasi-structural properties” of the field with its “phenomenological aspects” concerning the “feel for the game.” While the two understandings of field are interdependent, it is in the second one that the physical space as a localized social space played a crucial role in defining the material, social, and cultural constraints and opportunities actors faced which, in turn, influenced their practices and choices.",sociology
10.1111/1468-4446.12038,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>This paper re‐examines the sociological study of resistance in light of growing interest in the concept of affect. Recent claims that we are witness to an ‘affective turn’ and calls for a ‘new sociological empiricism’ sensitive to affect indicate an emerging paradigm shift in sociology. Yet, mainstream sociological study of resistance tends to have been largely unaffected by this shift. To this end, this paper presents a case for the significance of affect as a lens by which to approach the study of resistance. My claim is not simply that the forms of actions we would normally recognize as resistance have an affective dimension. Rather, it is that the theory of affect broadens ‘resistance’ beyond the purview of the two dominant modes of analysis in sociology; namely, the study of macropolitical forms, on the one hand, and the micropolitics of everyday resistance on the other. This broadened perspective challenges the persistent assumption that ideological forms of power and resistance are the most pertinent to the contemporary world, suggesting that much power and resistance today is of a more affective nature. In making this argument, it is a <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">D</jats:styled-content>eleuzian reading of affect that is pursued, which opens up to a level of analysis beyond the common understanding of affect as emotion. I argue that an affective approach to resistance would pay attention to those barely perceptible transitions in power and mobilizations of bodily potential that operate below the conscious perceptions and subjective emotions of social actors. These affective transitions constitute a new site at which both power and resistance operate.",sociology

I contrast Go's juxtaposition of imperial sociology on the one hand and anti‐colonial sociology on the other hand, with the broader range of theoretical traditions and methods, which a practice‐oriented sociology of sociology and an international history of sociology would highlight. I raise the question what “standpoint” adds to the authors Go discusses and the broader range of scholars who have engaged with post‐colonial contexts in their research at this point in time. Calling for consideration of the anti‐colonial standpoint is a particular choice, which has a distinctive heritage in Hegelian‐Marxian projections of the social whole and is in tension with either deep exploration of particular thinkers or the middle‐range theorizing that Go also seems to endorse. Defined at a level of abstraction that is “above” (or underneath) actual conversations in a range of fields and subfields, it can appear as a “test” for scholars who have long engaged with post‐colonial contexts, which can have unintended consequences when coupled with the institutional power and asymmetric insularity of Anglo‐American academia.",sociology

Furthermore, as a reading of Bateson through the lens of Durkheim will show, Bateson’s theories fail to provide a better understanding of social reality than those of his predecessors. This type of critical analysis demonstrates the weakness of some of Bateson’s central claims and contributes to a more in-depth understanding and reassessment of his ideas from a sociological perspective. Pointing out that Bateson’s critique of the modern worldview is based on a pre-critical and pre-modern philosophy of wholeness is not to invalidate Bateson’s foundational intuition that our current mode of thinking challenges our chances of surviving as a species.

The second is about how sociological knowledge is produced. “Traditional” public sociologists may communicate but not necessarily interact with publics, for example, through research reports, op‐ed pieces, or expert testimony. “Organic” public sociologists work in concert with local communities, organizations, and social movements in coproducing knowledge.",sociology

It was mostly the product or sequel of what economists (Schumpeter 1954) call the Copernican marginalist revolution in economic theory during the 1870–90s. Specifically, the crux of marginalism was a marginal‐utility theory of exchange value and its extensions (e.g., marginal‐productivity principle of income distribution) in reaction and contrast to the labor‐cost conception in classical political economy. The founders or pioneers of marginalism are commonly considered to be William Jevons (England), Carl Menger (Austria), and Leon Walras (Switzerland/France), who almost simultaneously in 1871–4 “discovered” marginal‐utility value theory as a putative revolutionary alternative to its labor‐based versions in Smith, Ricardo, Mill, Marx, and others. (For instance, Jevons specifically attacked Ricardo and Mill's theories, prompting neoclassical economists like Alfred Marshall to rise in their partial defense.) The term neoclassical economics was invented by (Thorstein Veblen Groenewegen 1995), a heterodox institutional economist, in the early 1900s to indicate that marginalism (e.g., marginal‐utility theory) was, in virtue of utilitarianism and hedonism, essentially continuous with and so “scarcely distinguishable” from classical political economy (which apparently overlooks the opposition of the marginalist revolution to Ricardo et al.'s labor theories of value). In this sense, the terms marginalism and neoclassical economics become interchangeable, though the first term is probably more accurate and precise for describing this stage and type of economic theory. Moreover, historians of economics such as Schumpeter (1954: 919) object that “there is no more sense in calling the Jevons‐Menger‐Walras theory neoclassic than there would be in calling the Einstein theory neo‐Newtonian.” This suggests that neoclassical economics is essentially marginalism (with partial exceptions like Marshall), but not conversely: the marginalist revolution is not newly, but counter‐classical (that is what makes it presumably “Copernican”).",sociology

Accounts provided in a survey of 250 individuals who knew people who had died in the UK are examined. The analysis counters the view that the denial of death is widespread in conditions where religion no longer offers individuals a meaningful narrative for the dying self. Scripts for proclaiming heroic self-identity in the face of death are promoted by cultural experts and appropriated by many lay individuals. This involves a struggle against external and internal enemies to gain knowledge, the opportunity to demonstrate courage and a beatific state of emotional accompaniment in which `carers' and dying people participate. Unlike more traditional forms of heroism, this script deviates from celebrating solely masculine qualities and includes a female heroics of care, concern and emotional expression.  At the same time, some deaths cannot be written into this script, which is particularly well suited to deaths from cancer and AIDs. The deaths of the very old, the mentally confused and sudden unexpected deaths are often difficult to interpret in these heroic terms. Additionally, a rival script exists amongst some lay individuals that stands in opposition to the professional consensus on the desirability of open awareness. This emphasises the benefits of continuing the everyday project of the self oblivious of oncoming death, with others shouldering the burden of awareness in an attempt to protect the dying person against the strain of knowledge. This rival script, however, commands decreasing allegiance in a society where the project of the self is rarely given over to the care of others, and trust is commonly negotiated in confessional moments.",sociology

               This chapter proposes an integral cognitive sociology capable of mediating between the sociocultural and naturalistic approaches that had all along been latent in critical theory but in the wake of the cognitive revolution can now be made explicit. The conviction driving the argument is that critical theory requires this complementary kind of cognitive sociology in order to secure its penetrating multilevel type of analysis and defining action- and praxis-oriented critical capacity. Framed by an autobiographical perspective, the first part traces the emergence of this cognitive sociology by identifying some starting points and prompts, both positive and negative, in the extant writings of relevant critical theorists. The second part is then devoted to an outline of the proposed cognitive sociology in terms of two key concepts: “the cognitive order” of the human sociocultural form of life and “weak naturalism.” The former allows a presentation of what the analysis of the sociocultural form of life according to the flow, structuring effects and dynamics of cognitive properties would entail. The latter allows the identification of the constraints impinging on the sociocultural world that derive from its ontological rootedness in nature. In contrast to strong naturalism, however, the sociocultural dimension is acknowledged as having epistemological priority for social science rather than being demoted to an epiphenomenon. While the thrust of the chapter is that critical theory urgently requires an integral cognitive sociology, it is apparent that contemporary cognitive sociology is as much in need of being complemented by a critical theoretical approach.",sociology

The basis of genetics is the observation that the biological constitution of all living things – plants, animals, fish, insects, bacteria, humans, etc. – is shaped by a chemical called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) found in the nuclear material of the cells from which they are all made. The various ways in which this chemical can be made up carry the instructions for the construction, articulation, and operation of cells. A gene is a segment of DNA that carries a particular set of instructions to perform a particular task in relation to cell assembly or functioning.

Designed to explain the two basic types of cognitive processing—one autonomous and the other requiring controlled attention, dual-process models became a natural partner for sociological theories of action, with their interest in parsing dispositional and deliberative types of action. This chapter offers an analytical review of the sociological literature that engages with dual-process models. It begins with an outline of the fundamentals of dual-process models in cognitive and social psychology, and follows with an examination of the premises that constitute what has come to be called the sociological dual-process model. It then reviews sociological research that applies dual-process models, dividing this literature into two distinct groups that are separated along sharp epistemological, methodological, and analytical lines. The first group is a largely consistent body of work that follows the premises of the sociological dual-process model, emphasizing the primacy of Type 1 processing, and investigating how this form of cognition shapes action. The second group comprises a more diverse body of work, examines Type 1 and Type 2 processing, and attempts to capture the processes that shape cognition and action. The chapter concludes with remarks about the critiques raised against dual-process models, along with their potential contributions to sociological analysis.",sociology

10.62272/js.v14.a2,"This paper focuses on the theoretical debates in sociology that acted as the driving force in its course of development drawing heavily from the thinking of Alvin Gouldner. Revolutionary transformation in the French society in late eighteenth century and the subsequent social disorder created the background of the development of positivism by Comte with the advocacy of restoring social order. Intermingling of different theories also took place as in the case of positivism furnishing the context for the emergence of structural functionalism. Interpretative sociology brought new dimension to the understanding of social phenomena by highlighting the perspective of the actors instead of the observer. In this vein it also discusses the emergence of intersubjectivity, ethnomethodology and related theoretical views. For obvious reason the paper deals elaborately with the perspective of Marxism. It underlines that structural functionalism presents society as an interwoven equilibrium while Marxism views the same as a conflicting whole with the effect of domination by the ruling class. This paper elaborates on the basic tenets of historical materialism as couched in Marxism. However, Marxist prognosis faltered in advanced capitalist countries of the Western hemisphere calling for new theoretical insight. Within Marxism it happened by examining the causal background of the continuation of capitalist countries, elaborated in this paper in the section on structural Marxism. The premise of sociology also necessitated the emergence of Durkheim and Weber who argued for different perspectives for the understanding of social order. The contributions of system theory and interactionism are duly acknowledged in this paper to weave a comprehensive intellectual tapestry being linked with debates and argumentation. The parallelism of system and individual brought dualism in sociological theory and Anthony Giddens took up attempt to draw a conflation between the two, unfolding a new dimension in the debate ridden sociological theories. The paper concluded with the discussion of Derrida and Lyotard to unfold the novel approach of post-modernism in challenging the claim of universality of modern theories.",sociology

This debate focuses either on the organisation of sociology in academic institutions or on how the content of sociologically informed interdisciplinary research diverges from disciplinary sociology. This article bridges these debates in a study of the sociology of food in Sweden. The aim is to analyse how Swedish food sociology reflects the tension between disciplinary sociology and interdisciplinary research. The data comprise the doctoral dissertations and post-PhD career paths of Swedish sociologists whose dissertations are about food. The article finds that these dissertations treat food either as an inherently social phenomenon or as a social lens (i.e. a social phenomenon viewed as instrumental for analysing something else). Second, it is found that sociologists whose dissertations treated food as an inherently social phenomenon were more likely to pursue careers in food sociology but also to hold affiliations outside of sociology departments. The article concludes that the academic locus of Swedish food sociology is organised outside sociology departments but that its approaches are not necessarily any less sociological. Thus, the analysis questions the basis for arguments that interdisciplinary research represents a threat to the critical and analytical core of sociology.",sociology

If engaging mortality is conceived as an example of the thinking of limits, I suggest that this ban parallels disavowing the question of meaning that the bourgeoisie have cultivated and perfected in the name of practical thinking. In this way, the bourgeoisie can be said to have mastered the secret of life and the connection between mental hygiene and intellectual parsimony celebrated by Kant as the advance of enlightenment. This adjustment is located at least as far back as the Stoics and replayed in much thought and in popular culture as a symptom of the self-destructiveness of the fixation on ‘ultimate meaning’ and its realistic pursuit in life. In this sense, the conditions of citizenship in the city are said to require a systemic disregard of such ‘deep’ concerns on Kantian grounds that their inaccessibility and irresolute character can only distract circumspection from its limited goals. Georg Simmel is maintained as the classical figure who both engaged death (and so the risk of thinking limit) and suffered marginalization for this, making his resolution of this tension not tragic, as his idiom suggests, but an exemplification of sociological artistry and of the playful relationship to life that it promises when unencumbered by the fear of the bourgeoisie.",sociology

A topic in moral philosophy for centuries, it has sociological aspects that have not been well studied. Inevitably, there is a complex range of functions motivating moral‐giving actions, including the social ends (benefits, rewards, etc.) that motivate donors. Assuming not to distinguish between motive and function as (potential) drivers, this study presents an analysis of the social motivations of moral giving from an integrative perspective. First, a particularist approach is considered and a novel synthesis of the micro‐macro dichotomy is outlined. Then, five major motivations or perspectives on moral giving are identified – those of religion, exchange relations, solidarity, rational choice, and social capital – and their micro/macro orientations and intersecting functions are briefly reviewed. An integrative model is thereby developed that incorporates mutually transitive relations between macro structures and micro agents and between the various social motives of moral giving.",sociology
10.1177/1749975510378193,"I provide here an analysis of how users choose and design personalized ringtones as an example of subjects’ current concerns with the management of social accessibility. As a result of the growing demands of ‘connected presence’ mobile phone users are faced with the proliferation of ringing phones in their soundscapes. They therefore exploit the new resources for customizing their ringtones with an orientation towards the management of the interactional problems which the development of ‘ubiquitous summoning’ may entail. Musical ringtones are chosen or designed by users, so that the shaping of the summons becomes a personal project of the recipients. They are shaped as ambiguous cues inviting two kinds of responsive actions, that is, treating them as a summons (inviting their being answered to) or as a music (inviting their being listened to). Their design becomes the locus of diverging rationales, with some users trying to exacerbate the summoning power of their phone ring and others to maximize their ambiguousness. Moreover musical ringtones are selected so as to constitute a personal gratification that the user addresses to himself (and sometimes also to potential bystanders). They become a ‘treat’ that users juxtapose and contrast with the obligation to answer that the ringtone incarnates. This provides evidence for a more general ‘crisis of the summons’ occurring as a collateral effect of increased availability requirements, which reshapes the ways we experience and perform the normative social order which underlies all social encounters.",sociology

Major areas of investigation include the social determinants of health and disease, the social behavior of patients and health care providers, the social functions of health organizations and institutions, the social patterns of the utilization of health services, the relationship of health care delivery systems to other social institutions, and social policies toward health. What makes medical sociology important is the critical role social factors play in determining or influencing the health of individuals, groups, and the larger society. Social conditions and situations not only promote and, in some cases, cause the possibility of illness and disability, but also enhance prospects of disease prevention and health maintenance. The earliest works in medical sociology were carried out by physicians in the United States, not sociologists who tended to ignore the field. This changed in the late 1940s when large amounts of federal funding became available to support joint research projects between sociologists and medical doctors. At its inception, work in medical sociology was oriented toward finding solutions relevant for clinical medicine. However, in 1950, Talcott Parsons, the leading theorist in sociology at that time, introduced his concept of the sick role that subsequently attracted other theoretical work and had an important role in the emergence of medical sociology as an academic field. Medical sociology has evolved to the point today that it investigates health and medical problems from an independent sociological perspective. Medical sociologists now comprise one of the largest and most active groups doing sociological work in North America and Europe, and the field has expanded to other regions as well.

Tourism cannot be treated in isolation since it embodies all tourism practices in a system they operate in. Thus, tourism is a complex sociocultural, economic, and political phenomenon and touches all levels of society. The investigation of tourism’s role in society, the tourism system’s effects on nature, tourism spaces, objects, practices, relationships, and the tourist typologies demand systematic sociological investigations. A researcher needs to consider the whole macro system through its members’ social, political, cultural, and economic interactions. In such a social context, both human and nonhuman actors continuously shape and reshape the tourism system, and the tourism system reshapes these actors’ values, attitudes, and behaviors. Researchers examining the sociology of tourism departed from several theoretical Perspectives, blended theory and method, and focused on sociological concepts to understand and explain the different aspects of tourism. This group of scholars has been working within the several cores of sociology (e.g., education, family, economy, development, religion, gender, language, migration, social inequalities, labor, art) and at the margins of emerging interdisciplinary formations, including those crossing many disciplines such as geography, anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, marketing, communication, women’s studies, history, and cultural studies.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0187,"<p>Cognitive sociology is the study of the conditions under which meaning is constituted through processes of reification. Cognitive sociology traces its origins to writings in the sociology of knowledge, sociology of culture, cognitive and cultural anthropology, and more recently, work done in cultural sociology and cognitive science. Its central questions revolve around locating these processes of reification since the locus of cognition is highly contentious. Researchers consider how individuality is related to notions of society (structures, institutions, systems, etc.) and notions of culture (cultural forms, cultural structures, sub-cultures, etc.). These questions further explore how these answers depend on learning processes (socialization, acculturation, etc.) which vary according to the position one takes on the role of language in cognition. It is from these positions that we operationalize a theory of human nature and construct a justification for the organization of the state of human affairs and the related conceptualizations of identity, self, and the subject. In this way, cognitive sociology seeks to establish the minimal model of the actor (the ontology) that underpins not only other subfields of sociology but also the human sciences in general. In this way, cognitive sociology analyzes the series of interpersonal processes that set up the conditions for phenomena to become “social objects,” which subsequently shape thinking and thought. In classical cognitive sociology, the historical traditions of the sociology of knowledge and phenomenology are emphasized, with the work of Bourdieu and Goffman given special treatment, given their contributions as precursors to many of the contemporary contingencies and consequences of debates in culture and cognition. The principle organizing the more contemporary literature are the paradigmatic assumptions concerning the locus of cognition, which have been organized into five ideal-types. These elucidate the points of agreement and disagreement in the field by addressing how thematic concerns (e.g., knowledge, rationality, embodiment, practices, discourse, etc.) highlight the priority of individuality in modeling society, to illustrate what makes cognitive sociology at once interdisciplinary yet contentiously distinct in addressing the politics of “tacit knowledge.”</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0221,"<p>This article curates scholarship around those understandings identified to be “knowledges.” It investigates their production, legitimating institutions, and their experiences and embodiments. It emphasizes those conceptualizations excluded from canonizations of knowledge. This knowledge cultural sociology (KCS) recognizes the importance of the Mannheimian tradition, and its extensions, that explain how social relations shape the articulations and validations of knowledge. However, KCS also situates knowledge within systems beyond those who produce and consume it. KCS views knowledge as itself necessarily contested, as struggles over its qualities reflect social locations and articulate social practices. In making knowledge over the subject of inquiry, KCS works to understand how knowledges’ symbols, schemas, institutions, and networks shape the terms of social reproduction and transformations. As such, KCS demands consideration of different kinds of knowledge cultural products and modes of communication. KCS is thus necessarily grounded in the question of what constitutes knowledge, and for whom and with what interests and expectations. This KCS intervention focuses on 21st-century work. This decision aims to engage scholarship that extends and challenges a 20th-century canon; including works from the 20th century signals scholarship yearning for expansion. The article is not comprehensive, but marks how knowledge is valued and ignored. To focus on this century and move beyond sociology allows engagement with ways of knowing and being that sociology has historically minoritized, moving consideration to structures and processes validating some kinds of knowledge over others. KCS is not canonization, but works toward liberation, a knowledge activism mobilizing knowledge in consequential public ways alongside more familiar scholarly ambitions. KCS moves scholarship beyond familiar networks and self-reproducing knowledge hierarchies grounded in race, gender, sexuality, religion, and world region. It seeks to move dialogue beyond knowledge silos and to identify new and ignored ideas, meanings, references, and authorities for constituting knowledges of consequence, reframing contests along the way. For example, instead of asking how excellence and diversity can be combined in knowledge production, KCS asks what anti-racist knowledge excellence can be. Accounts of epistemology ought to foreground the contexts and power relations in which those knowledge sensibilities are formed and communicated; thus, the references in this article move generally from concept to context. Likewise, sections moving toward global, post-socialist, and postcolonial discussions inform ontologies and epistemologies organizing scholarly work and public consequence. But this begins with what might be identified, in this entry at least, as the greatest hits of KCS.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0154,"<p>Rural sociology is a unique area of sociological inquiry. Its institutional development leaves it perhaps the most independent of all sociological subfields. Rural sociology in the United States emerged in the early 20th century when federal funding was earmarked to the land grant universities (public universities) to study and assist the farm population. Separate “rural” sociology departments appeared gradually within colleges of agriculture that paralleled the substantive areas found in general sociology departments. Thus, one finds in rural sociology a replication of many core areas in general sociology but with a rural twist—inequality, demography, work/labor markets, race/ethnicity, gender, community, and so forth. Over time, additional rural-oriented specialty areas emerged, notably the sociology of agriculture and natural resource/environmental sociology. Rural sociology has also expanded globally. As a consequence, the substantive scope of contemporary research is large and varied. What knits the work together is a focus on the geographic periphery, that is, the places, populations, and forms of social activity found in rural areas globally which has provided boundary and meaning to the field. In addition to its broad substantive scope, rural sociology is characterized by a distinct research approach. Research tends to be comparative: rural places and populations are often set in contrast with regard to their urban counterparts to ascertain similarities and differences. In this way, rural sociological research is often said to challenge the urban bias of general sociology. Disciplinary practice is also distinct. While there are few departments with rural sociology in their name today, courses and specializations in the field are found across many land grant universities. There is a long tradition of cross-disciplinary linkages particularly with agricultural economics, the environmental sciences, and more recently geography. Rural sociologists have been highly active in federal, state, and local public policy circles and in public sociology efforts that contribute to community development, sustainable agricultural and food systems, and social and environmental justice. In terms of work in the profession, rural sociologists also work outside of colleges of agriculture, within government agencies, international development agencies, and across governmental and non-governmental institutions. Although rural populations will continue to decline globally, there is reason to think that rural sociology will have broad influence in the future because the research areas it encompasses are of growing interest to social scientists, policymakers, and the public at large.

At the end of the 19th century all of sociology’s European founders turned to historical explanation to understand the changes that capitalism had brought to their societies, from Marx’s attempt to explain history as the working out of class struggle, to Weber’s investigations into the comparative development of economy and society, to Durkheim’s investigations into the historical development of religion, law, and the division of labor. These early historical arguments were eclipsed, however, by the behavioral revolution and the explosion of statistical tools and techniques of the mid-20th century, which re-founded the discipline as the study of large numbers of individual actors or units. Only when revolutions and social change became increasingly pressing political concerns in the 1960s and 1970s did a large number of scholars once again turn to comparative historical sociology as the form of sociological explanation most appropriate to analyzing changes that occur infrequently or over very long periods, and that affect a society as a whole unit. While the classics of the discipline focus on European history, contemporary scholars are extending the approach to the rest of the world. Current areas of great interest include the question of why China did not experience an industrial revolution in the 18th century, the role of the state in economic development, and the transition to capitalism in eastern Europe. Some think that the study of rare events requires different methods from those common in the rest of sociology, and accordingly a lively methodological discussion is underway in the field. Because there has been great interest in the state as the source of much social transformation, the subfield overlaps considerably with macro political sociology; but comparative historical scholars are also interested in processes of social and economic change beyond the realm of the political.</p>",sociology

The field incorporates insights from economics, behavioral psychology, economic anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Structural and cultural approaches largely characterize the studies conducted in the field, with the former associated with networks, institutions, and social organization; the latter, rituals, symbols, cognitive frameworks, and narratives. Economic sociologists study how social networks and relationships affect economic actions, such as the provision of loans, the acquisition of a job, and the successful construction of deals. Empirical studies examine how prices are set, why some pricing schemes that do not seem rational are instead understandable and predictable, and how markets are incorporated into social life, and vice versa.</p>",sociology

The study of music in society has been of interest to canonic social thinkers, including Weber, Simmel, and Adorno, since the establishment of sociology. The study of music has also concerned scholars in adjacent disciplines, particularly musicology, cultural studies, and economics. In the landmark Distinction, Bourdieu argued, “nothing more clearly affirms ones ‘class,’ nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music” (Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste [London: Routledge, 1984], p. 18). Sociologists of music have accordingly been concerned with the importance of musical taste for signifying status and distinguishing cultural hierarchies. Sociologists have also been concerned with the socio-demographic correlates of musical preference, how musicians and the music industry organize to provide music and influence taste, and the education and working conditions of musicians. What tends to distinguish sociology of music from other disciplines is a commitment to the sociological imagination or the use of social research methods—but not necessarily both. And many sociologists of music work across disciplines. Sociologists have also coalesced around the study of different genres, and those contributing in the sociology of particular genres often do so not as sociologists but as music, folklore, or history scholars whose interests have extended to the sociology of music. The American sociology of music tradition has arguably been influenced more heavily by symbolic interactionism and rational choice theory than the European, where critical theory has been more influential. Nevertheless, conceptual and methodological interchange is growing, particularly with the increasing influence of Bourdieu in US sociology. The sociology of race, gender, and sexuality has also influenced the field significantly. This conceptual and methodological diversity means the field has low paradigmaticness. However, this diversity does lead to productive exchange and synthesis of ideas and methods. Notably, there is growing interest in music as a social technology and insights from science and technology studies. As in cultural sociology more broadly, attention is turning to “the music itself,” music as mediating social interaction, and artists and works embedded in wider socio-musical systems using computational tools, particularly network analysis. Data proliferation is generating innovative quantitative work. Qualitative research is also being reinvigorated by new technologies enabling new interview methods, digital ethnography, and computational methods for processing textual data.</p>",sociology

In common usage, the term “culture” can mean the cultivation associated with “civilized” habits of mind, the creative products associated with the arts, or the entire way of life associated with a group. Among sociologists, “culture” just as often refers to the beliefs that people hold about reality, the norms that guide their behavior, the values that orient their moral commitments, or the symbols through which these beliefs, norms, and values are communicated. The sociological study of culture encompasses all these diverse meanings of “culture.” Amid this diversity, what unifies the sociology of culture are two core commitments: that the symbolic-expressive dimension of social life is worthy of examination, both for its own sake and because of its impact on other aspects of social life; and that culture can be studied using the methods and analytic tools of sociology. Within the discipline, the sociology of culture emerged as a bounded subfield during the 1980s. Prior to this period, sociological analyses of culture were found mainly in theoretical treatises and in empirical studies of religion, the arts, and the “sociology of knowledge.” Throughout, the sociological study of culture has been oriented by a common set of broad questions: What are the social origins of culture? What cultural patterns are found in various groups and institutions? And what influence does culture have on important aspects of society? Scholarship in the sociology of culture ranges from highly general conceptual arguments to closely observed empirical studies. The readings included here reflect this breadth.</p>",sociology

A related subfield is military sociology, which focuses more explicitly on the organization and functioning of military forces and civil- military relations. These lines of scholarship are bound together by the basic premise that understanding war necessitates understanding those who fight it, and vice versa. The sociology of war overlaps with other fields that share an interest in government and politics, such as military history, political sociology, political science, and international relations. However, these fields tend to be concerned primarily with how wars begin and end, whereas the sociology of war tends to focus more explicitly on the cultural and social implications of war and how war and society act and react upon each other. With a few notable exceptions, the sociology of war remained mostly isolated within the field of comparative historical sociology until the 1980s, when two trends opened the door for an interdisciplinary sociology of war. The first was the dissipation of a war taboo, widespread in American academia and connected to the social resistance against the Vietnam War throughout the 1960s and 1970s. A renewed interest in the social implications of war also occurred as the end of the Cold War raised new questions about the role of the state in war making and the future of warfare. Renewed interdisciplinary interest in the origins of the modern nation-state led to a reexamination of the role that warfare played in the emergence and spread of the state system. In the decade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2011 the sociology of war focused extensively on questions related to the role of nonstate combatant groups, the apparent increase in asymmetrical war in the post–Cold War era, and the meaning that such transformations in war making may carry for the societies that wage them. As the Global War on Terror nears the end of its second decade, scholars have increasingly turned their attention to understanding the interactions between state and society as the lines between peacetime and wartime become less distinguishable. Most recently, the sociology of war has exhibited a broadening in scope, with greater emphasis on examining how war is situated within larger patterns of social violence.</p>",sociology

Broadly, sociolinguists investigate the relationship between social context and language structure or use on the assumption that aspects of structure and use require reference to social context for their description and explanation. In practice, the “socio-“of sociolinguistics can refer to three things, separately or in combination: an act or action of language use that requires, minimally, two people for its performance or one person acting as two; language use that is connected to the identity or identities, be they achieved or attributed, of a speaker or speakers; and/or language use that is involved in the expression of ideology. Using these three types of social facts, we may ask how researchers find the social in a sociolinguistic analysis of structure and use. We suggest here that sociolinguists use three fundamental approaches. Each involves a positioning of the social with respect to the linguistic or the linguistic with respect to the social. These approaches are: Constraint Approach: One may find the social as extra-linguistic constraints or conditions on use of competing forms. Indexicality Approach: One may find the social as indexed by structures/forms, codes (styles, dialects, languages), or acts. Discursive Construction Approach: One may find the social in the explicit and inferrable details of collaborative, sequential, discursive construction. Because the Indexical and Discursive Construction approaches overlap, we will present selected readings in two broad categories. In the first, we will focus on research in Variationist Sociolinguistics which most aptly illustrates the Constraint Approach. However, in Variationist work, the Indexical Approach also appears within research into the Social Meanings of variation. In turn, we will review key publications in socially informed discourse analysis which further illustrate both the Indexical and Discursive Construction Approaches.</p>",sociology

The enormity of the suffering has led to an interest in fascism and its origins, with the hope that understanding what it is and why it occurred will prevent it from happening again. The sociological study of fascism is historical, interdisciplinary, and comparative. A key feature of the scholarship is the debate about fascism’s definition. Because it was the world’s first fascist regime, some claim that the characteristics of Italian fascism under Mussolini should form the basis for the definition, or that Italian fascism is the only instance of fascism. Others argue that the political ideologies and groups that marked the first half of the 20th century had a number of features in common and that, although fascism played out differently in national contexts, a generic definition is possible. Recent scholarship points to a consensus in favor of a generic definition. Fascism promised a solution to the divisions and decay wrought by liberal democracy and communism through mass mobilization, national cleansing, and national rebirth. Roger Griffin said fascism was “palingenetic populist ultranationalism” (Griffin 1993, p. 26, cited under Definitions). Whether fascism manifests as an intellectual current, social movement, political party, or regime also figures in its definition because fascism’s form affects what it can do. Some comparative research focuses on differences between fascism and other authoritarian, conservative, or right-wing groups, as well as relations between fascists and these groups. Since the rebirth that fascism promises usually entails controlling biological and cultural reproduction, women’s roles in fascist ideology and regimes have been the subject of recent studies. Scholars have also likened fascism to religion, for its reliance on myths, symbols, rituals, and commemoration in both ideology and practice, and have studied fascism as an example of totalitarianism, often in comparison to communist Russia. Debates about the definition of fascism are inextricably linked to theories of its emergence. Some scholars explain fascism’s origins by looking at intellectual, cultural, political, or economic factors. Others claim that the only way to understand why fascism occurred is to study its leaders and their intentions (e.g., Adolf Hitler), and its members, voters, and supporters. The definition of fascism and its organizational form also affect which countries are studied, whether for case or comparative analysis. Italy and Germany have received the most attention, but many other countries are the subject of inquiry too. Some scholars have examined dozens of countries in an effort to classify them as fascist or otherwise. The scope of fascist studies expands as new insights emerge, as more disciplines become involved, as new methods of inquiry are developed, and as new sources of data become available, such as archives in Russia, eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Vatican. Finally, many scholars are preoccupied by the possibility of fascism’s return in today’s far right in countries all over the world. These are studies for which questions about definition and origins are also important, but perhaps more pressing are concerns about the activities of these groups and whether they pose a threat to democracy and, if so, how to contain them.</p>",sociology

A number of key questions can be raised about any given preservation effort: What kinds of claims are being made when mnemonic activists declare a building or a neighborhood to be “historic”? Whose vision of history is being wielded when monuments and other spaces of consecration are laid down in the urban fabric? What are the cultural frames that are mobilized to socially construct such landscapes as “historic” versus those are simply “historical”?

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0072,"<p>Food studies as a distinct field within sociology has seen extensive interest and growth. Previously, studies of food production and consumption typically fell under the purview of research on health, agrarian studies, development sociology, agricultural economy, or social anthropology. Rural and natural resource sociologists especially have long emphasized the management and impacts of food production systems in their work. In classical tomes food was typically mentioned as an example of social classification or of social problems rather than a distinct object of study. Since the 1980s sociologists’ attention to how food strengthens social ties; marks social and cultural differences; and is integrated into social organizational forms, ranging from households to empires, has grown. Early-21st-century interest in food by both researchers and the larger public follows heightened awareness of the global character of markets and politics, concerns with health and safety, and the ways cooking and dining out have become fodder for media spectacle. Today sociologists of food display considerable diversity in their theoretical approaches, research methods, and empirical foci. Sociologists draw upon both classic and contemporary sociological theorists to study food’s production, distribution, and consumption as well as how food and eating are integrated into social institutions, systems, and networks. Topically, sociologists contribute to research on inequality and stratification, culture, family, markets, politics and power, identity, status, social movements, migration, labor and work, health, the environment, and globalization. Sociological work on food in the late 20th and early 21st centuries is characterized by two overlapping threads: food systems (derived in part from scholarship on agricultural production and applied extension as well as environmental, developmental, and rural sociology) and food politics, identity, and culture (which reveals social anthropological and cultural-historical undertones). Both are nested in the emerging interdisciplinary research field of food studies, which has gained greater institutional footholds at universities in Europe and Australia than in the United States and Canada (but this may be changing). Sociologists working across the two threads examine issues of food and inequality, trade, labor, power, capital, culture, and technological innovation. This article maps out social science research and theorizing on what we eat, how we produce and procure food, who benefits, with whom we eat, what we think about food, and how food fits with contemporary social life.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0075,"<p>A rudimentary definition of consumption emphasizes the purchase and use of goods or services, noting that the point of expenditure on such items and the instant of their usage constitute the act of consumption. This understanding of consumption reflects a utilitarian, economic approach to consumption that should be seen as a starting point, since the range of theoretical and empirical innovations within the field of consumption studies—which exists within sociology, as well as having disciplinary expressions within anthropology, history, geography, business, and marketing studies—has established an understanding of consumption as a complex, widespread process. “The Sociology of Consumption” by Colin Campbell in Daniel Miller, ed., Acknowledging Consumption: A Review of New Studies (London: Routledge, 1995) adds a number of other stages to this basic definition of consumption. Campbell states that consumption involves not just purchasing or using a good or service but also selecting it, maintaining it, possibly repairing it, and ultimately, disposing of it in some way. Within each of these stages there are a number of complex subprocesses that consumption studies scholars have increasingly paid attention to. For example, the selection of goods is sometimes undertaken largely subconsciously or automatically but also based upon various social norms, cultural learning, emotional factors, prejudices, facets of identity, taste, or style. Likewise, disposing of a good may mean literally throwing it away, or it may mean reselling it, donating it, or passing it on to others. Campbell’s definition usefully shows how consumption is a process over time that fuses practical, emotional, material, and economic factors, rather than merely the moment when a person pays for something over the counter. In many ways, this broader understanding of consumption points to a range of innovations within the field that have occurred in the last few decades, which in turn direct us to broader changes in patterns of sociological inquiry. Questions of labor, industry, production units, social, legal, and economic institutions, technology, and social class were the core stuff of social inquiry through much of the 20th century. In mainstream sociology, consumption was for most of the discipline’s history simply not a relevant analytic category, which explains why for much of sociology’s history consumption was understood through theories of capitalist production. However, in the last few decades researchers have increasingly situated practices of consumption and a consumerist ethic as central for understanding broader social and cultural change, impacting on the way sociologists have conceptualized such diverse areas of social change as cultural and economic inequality, urban and spatial development, identity and selfhood, gender relations and performativity, media, and advertising.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0036,"<p>Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the study of knowledge, with knowledge traditionally defined as justified true belief. Classical epistemology set up a dualism between the mind and a material reality external to the mind. The problem to solve then became that of explaining how ideas in the mind could be known to mirror objects outside the mind. For the rationalist tradition, the solution to this problem lay in arguing that the mind had a priori ideas, meaning ideas that existed independently of experience. For the empiricist tradition, the solution to this problem lay in arguing that the mind had a posteriori ideas, meaning ideas stemming from experience or, more precisely, sense data inputs. Alternative positions could adhere to some form of idealism or skepticism. With idealism, reality becomes defined in terms of our ideas of it, and with skepticism it is held that knowledge cannot be attained because we can never know if our ideas mirror objects outside our minds. Later, philosophical attention turned from the issue of discussing whether or not ideas in the mind could mirror objects outside the mind to language. Debates then ensued about whether truth was a matter of correspondence between a statement and a fact. Philosophers concerned with scientific knowledge addressed the issue of what method defined science. For many, there could be a sociology of error but not a sociology of knowledge. What this meant was that while a diligent application of the scientific method would explain the production of truth, error could be explained by “social factors” distorting this process. Examples of social factors could be religious or political commitments. In sociology, epistemology is not a clearly defined topic. Instead, there are a broad range of issues, which may be summarized with the following questions: Should sociology seek scientific knowledge and, if so, how is science to be defined? Can qualitative research give explanatory knowledge of relations of cause and effect as well as quantitative research? Should sociology reject any attempt to explain relations of cause and effect, on the basis that social reality does not have law-like phenomena, in order to understand the shared meanings of agents? How can theoretical abstractions be justified? Should sociologists adopt a broad definition of knowledge to include agents’ understanding of the social and political world, irrespective of whether agents’ beliefs are actually true? Should all domains of knowledge, including the knowledge produced by the natural sciences, be regarded as influenced by sociocultural factors or even completely relative to the prevailing sociohistorical environment? Should value judgments influence the production and dissemination of sociological knowledge? Has sociological knowledge contributed to the reproduction of inequalities by ignoring women and using a research process that is ultimately hierarchical and oppressive? Is a canon of classical texts of any intellectual use for the production of contemporary sociological knowledge? In other words, the issues concerning epistemology in sociology pertain to the status and range of sociological knowledge.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0259,"<p>Conservatism refers to one of the constituent political positions found in all contemporary democracies. It can be construed as a philosophy, an ideology, a political party, a movement, a disposition, a mode of discourse, performance style, and an emotional relationship to the political. Since the birth of modern democracies in the aftermath of the French Revolution, it has become commonplace to describe the range of political options available to the citizenry as occupying a spectrum from left to right, with a range of alternatives between the extreme poles, including a centrist position in the middle that straddles the divide. The left was associated with promoting challenges to established authorities and existing hierarchies, along with calls for increased economic equality and expanded social and political rights to all citizens, including the heretofore marginalized. This contrasts with the right, which was defined as defending inequalities and differential entitlements, concentrating matters involving rights around preserving property rights, shoring up public and social order, and promoting traditional values and conventional social relations. In this context, liberalism became a mark of political identity associated with the left, as did socialism, while conservatism, broadly construed, represented the right. This framing of politics also includes the possibility of underminings by extremism on both the left and right. For the former, the main threat since the Russian Revolution has been posed by revolutionary communism, while right-wing extremism has manifested itself in reactionary movements, including fascism and illiberal populism. Since liberalism and conservatism must be understood in relational terms, the spatial and temporal settings for the politics of opposition will vary considerably. It is impossible to do justice to the vast literature on conservatism in a bibliography such as this. What follows is a more delimited, and thus manageable examination of work on conservatism. First, it focuses on conservatism in the United States, and not elsewhere. Second, it is chiefly concerned with conservatism since the end of World War II. Third, it concentrates on the study of conservatism by sociologists and those working in cognate disciplines; while not all the authors are card-carrying sociologists, their works reflect a sociological character, although the exception to this third point is the overview section, which presents key readings by advocates of conservatism, and thus offers insider depictions of the meaning of conservatism. Fourth, this article does not concentrate solely on extremist right-wing movements; rather, in surveying the relevant literature on American conservatism broadly construed, it points to a growing consensus that the radical right wing has pushed mainstream conservatism increasingly further to the right.</p>",sociology

(Indeed, for several decades the field seemed so innovative that it was regularly termed the “new” social history.) The field has two foci. First, social history emphasizes large numbers of people in the past, rather than just elites or leading individuals. Common categories include social classes, Gender, Race and ethnic group, and age. Social historians see the history of ordinary people as contributing greatly to an understanding of the past, and often they argue that ordinary people display more independent initiative than was commonly assumed by conventional historians. Often some tension emerges between a focus on groups of ordinary people as targets of mistreatment and the claims of more active agency. Second, and closely linked originally to the focus on ordinary people, social historians analyze a variety of aspects of human and social behavior. They reject the tendency of conventional historians to concentrate heavily on formal politics, diplomacy, and great ideas alone. This aspect of social history has expanded steadily. It leads to a host of subfields, including family and childhood, leisure and consumerism, health and disease, and crime, and the list continues to grow as historians respond to changing social patterns and needs. Some tension has developed between interest in a wider range of topics and the earlier commitment to ordinary people, as some new topics are best explored, at least initially, through elite or middle-class sources. Social history’s topical range has also fueled complaints about a lack of overall coherence, though social historians frequently organize their many topics around major developments like industrialization. Many historians identified themselves strongly as social historians during the early decades of the field’s emergence. This singular identification has softened over time, and many historians in the early 21st century “do” social history as part of a larger commitment, usually to a geographical region. Social history has also drawn different levels of attention in various world regions. The field is better developed, for example, in China or the West than in the Middle East. Finally, social historical work has often, but not always, developed with some interdisciplinary connections, particularly to historical sociology.</p>",sociology

In order to situate the idea of financialisation in a sociological context, I show how the financial crisis of 2007-2008 gave weight to the weightless fictitious capital of the fully financialised world in the form of the dead weight of debt that crushes the indebted and creates a new power relation, which Maurizio Lazzarato writes of in terms of the creditor / debtor relation.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0059,"<p>Anarchism developed as a distinctive strain within radical and revolutionary thought in the mid-19th century. The political theory, often associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (b. 1809–d. 1865), Michael Bakunin (b. 1814–d. 1876), and Peter Kropotkin (b. 1842–d. 1921), appeared in parallel with a worldwide, international movement that shaped anarchist practices and that gave expression to a critique of capitalist exploitation, state tyranny, and an idea of rebelliousness that has been influential in sociopolitical, economic, and cultural realms. Contemporary anarchists argue about both the continuities and the discontinuities between the historical and modern movements and the antecedents of European anarchism, but there is a strong consensus that anarchism cannot be reduced to a single set of principles, conceptual arrangements, or theoretical positions that might be applied in practice, analysis, or critique. Because canonical approaches to the history of anarchist ideas are typically resisted, and because the ideological boundaries of anarchism remain contested, anarchist approaches to sociological issues are distinguished by their diversity and are difficult to pin down. However, the anarchists’ traditional opposition to processes associated with state formation, and their interrogation of the complex relationships between these processes and capitalism, society, technology, and culture, are important frames for the discussion of perennial themes, notably, domination, organization, and transformation. Reflections on the rise of the modern European state and the possibility of nonstate organization have long encouraged an interest in anthropology, supporting strongly normative accounts of mutuality, cooperation, and reciprocity. In the anticapitalist mainstream, anarchism supports a rich tradition of thinking about self-regulation, self-management, and decentralized federation. The anarchists’ principled rejection of authority has fostered an interest in systems of education, law, punishment, concepts of crime, and the institutionalization of love in heterosexual relationships, generating cultural practices and literatures that are at once subversive and utopian. Anarchist utopianism is in turn an important strain in urban design, art, and ecology. The anarchist eschewal of institutional politics and advocacy of direct action have focused attention on issues of struggle, protest, and violence as well as the theorization of direct action and prefigurative change. Notwithstanding anarchist suspicions of the elitism and complicity of academic institutions, anarchism has had an influence on mainstream sociology and is equally influenced by critical strains within it. The relationship with Marxism, though often unhappy, has provided one route into sociology. Max Weber’s engagements with anarchism have provided another; and, in late-20th- and early-21st-century history, anarchists have begun to develop approaches to sociology that resonate with both traditions.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0029,"<p>Genocide is now understood as a major type of collective violence, with a distinctive place in the spectrum of political violence, armed conflict, and war, of which it is usually seen as a part. However the idea of genocide dates only from the 1940s, when in the space of four years after its introduction (in a critique of Nazi occupation policies during the Second World War), it became the subject of a major international convention. The concept quickly become central to political and cultural discourses about violence, but the developed academic study of the phenomenon took some decades to develop, before finally taking off around the end of the Cold War. The rapidly expanding field is interdisciplinary, with major contributions from historians, sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, legal scholars, and others. It has highly contested parameters, including the definition of the phenomenon, the universe of cases, the appropriate explanatory frameworks, and so on. It is also considerably politicized, with significant disagreements over how the academic study of genocide should be related to the development of international policies for its prevention. The field’s growth came initially through the extension of understandings of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, which by the late 20th century was known as “the Holocaust,” to other cases, both historic (such as the Ottoman extermination of the Armenians) and contemporary (such as the Cambodian and Rwandan genocides). However, it has since expanded to consider phenomena quite different from the Holocaust in scale and form, such as the diverse and long-drawn-out pattern of genocide during European colonization of the non-Western world. At the same time, the transformations of political violence and war in the post–Cold War world have led to new divergences over the applicability of the genocide idea to recent events. Recent cases, such as the former Yugoslavia, have raised questions about the relationships of population removal and sexual violence to genocide. Because of these tensions, the growth of the field has been accompanied by theoretical, paradigm, and political differences. This bibliography attempts to capture these features of a fast-moving academic field and to provide the reader with a way to explore its essential literature.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0262,"<p>Sociology has an oddly imperfect, even problematic, relationship with public space (and space in general). Taking public space to mean any site that is, at least in principle, open and commonly accessible to all, it is of course the location for an enormous amount of all social interactions that occur outside of the intimacy of home or the professional context of work. It is the stage on which Goffman’s actors perform their presentations of self. From Simmel’s Metropolis and Mental Life through the research of the early Chicago School to countless contemporary ethnographies, urban space in particular is central to sociology. So much of social life takes place on streets or plazas, in public libraries, markets, and subway cars, or in so-called third spaces like cafes and pubs (public houses, after all). Public spaces have countless social characteristics and sociological implications. And yet relatively little sociological research focuses on public space itself, often relegating it at best to context—a crucial variable perhaps, certainly often a field site and the setting for a study, but rarely the object of analysis. Some sociologists who have followed a “spatial turn” are in truth interdisciplinarians by training (e.g., Herbert Gans, Neil Brenner); others began as sociologists and wound up rather outside of the discipline altogether (e.g., William H. Whyte). Still, public space is a natural domain of social research and ought to be a comfortable home to the sociologist. Whether for the pioneering community studies of the 20th century or today’s graduate students conducting surveys and observing daily life, the street corner, the park, the library are essential elements of study.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0067,"<p>No concept is more widely used in sociology than that of “class.” Rooted in the writings of Marx and Engels, as well as Weber, Durkheim, Sorokin, and other classical social theorists, class has long been one of the key analytical concepts sociologists have deployed to explain a wide variety of outcomes. This wide usage does not, however, mean that “class” is always defined in consistent ways by sociologists, or that it is necessarily among the most important factors in accounting for any particular social phenomena. There are two features that all conceptualizations of class share. The first is that societies are organized unequally in a vertical fashion, with some people at the top possessing more power, income and wealth, and privileges than people at the bottom. These advantages (or disadvantages) are rooted (at least in part) in the economic relationships between individuals and households. Exactly how classes are defined and categorized, however, remains contested. Second, all class theories start from the proposition that the types of class relationships found in any society matter for other social processes. At the micro level, class location of individuals or households predicts such things as income and wealth, social and political attitudes, marriage, friendships and social networks, voting behavior, cultural consumption, and life chances. At the macro level, class power influences policy and political outcomes, as well as social movement organizations and capacities.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0134,"<p>The term cultural omnivorousness was first introduced to the cultural consumption literature by Richard Peterson in 1992 (see Peterson 1992 [cited under Reference Texts]) to refer to a particular cultural appreciation profile. According to his definition, this profile emerged in the late 20th century, in accordance with macro changes experienced in the socioeconomic and political spheres. Omnivorous consumers have an increased breadth of cultural taste and a willingness to cross established hierarchical cultural genre boundaries. In other words, the concept refers to a taste profile that includes both highbrow and lowbrow genres. Peterson’s initial studies—with Kern and Simkus—used data on tastes in music in the United States. Later, especially after researchers in Europe developed an interest in the term, many other cultural consumption domains were analyzed to see whether highbrow taste profiles tend to become less exclusive. This interest has been so consistent that we now have sufficient empirical and theoretical research to label the discussion a coherent sociological “debate.” The relationship between omnivorous orientation and variables such as education, age, gender, class, ethnicity, and race has been analyzed in many different national contexts and cultural fields. The omnivore thesis is extremely important for contemporary cultural theory because it pushes researchers to scrutinize the current status of the relationship between culture and power. The contributors to this debate have provided competing answers to the following crucial questions: What is the strength and direction of the association between socioeconomic status and cultural taste? Are we witnessing the decomposition of cultural-class boundaries and snobbishness? How far does cultural omnivorousness bring tolerance and cultural inclusion? These questions, asked within the debate, demonstrate the concept’s significance for our understanding of sociocultural change. Many case studies have shown that eclectic repertoires are more likely to be embodied by the educated middle classes. Peterson himself argued that the employment market has begun to seek this kind of wide-ranging awareness and cultural inclusiveness. It seems that being a true omnivore requires certain skills, investment, and prior cultural knowledge, which can be translated into advantages in other social fields. Moreover, empirical research is now sufficient enough to show that omnivores are selective and they show little tolerance for the genres associated with lower social/cultural status. Therefore, this repertoire may very well be considered a new form of distinction—a strategy the economically and culturally advantaged use to “make” their identity and distinguish themselves from others. The debate has progressed quite successfully. Many different types of omnivorousness have been discovered since the term was first coined; not every eclectic repertoire holder follows the same trajectory of boundary crossing. For instance, some omnivorous consumers cross the highbrow-lowbrow boundary by adding highbrow genres to their profile after having experienced upward mobility, while others include lowbrow genres to their once exclusive highbrow taste repertoires. Different forms of omnivorousness—and their degree of cultural tolerance—allow us to see more clearly the current status of the association between cultural hierarchy and consumption. Although limited in quantity, some important research has been done critically questioning the kind of social structures, institutions, national contexts, and school curricula that enlarge the cultural cultivated fractions’ repertoires. Recent research on contemporary forms of cultural capital and cosmopolitanism also engages closely with the omnivore debate. It is important to note that arguments still remain with regard to methods and analysis; not every contributor agrees on a common definition for measurement—operationalization—of the omnivore profiles. Some researchers take participation, while others take taste or knowledge, as proxies to measure omnivorousness. Some contributors measure only the breadth (the status of the genres preferred) and others measure volume of tastes (the number of preferred genres/activities) without looking at their composition, namely how far people cross boundaries. Other disagreements (methodological and theoretical) with regard to other aspects of the debate have been briefly referred to above. These disagreements not only make the debate more lively and dynamic, but also ensure that interest in the concept does not decrease over time.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0060,"<p>Social status is a central dimension of stratification, making up one leg of the traditional “class, status, power” division among the bases of societal inequality. Originating in the work of Max Weber, this division, by asserting the independent influence of status groups and interests, represented a key departure from Karl Marx’s insistence on the primacy of economic or class relationships. Despite the long-established prominence of this concept in the field of sociology, status has been variously defined and employed. Some definitions, following Veblen, focus on the individual aspects of status, referring to the rank, prestige, or esteem of one’s position in a social hierarchy. Other definitions focus on status groups or communities defined by shared lifestyles; these groups use these common status identities to gain access to valuable resources, privileges, and entitlements and defend those they already possess. Contemporary empirical research on status has focused primarily on socioeconomic status or experimental studies of small groups, although there is a burgeoning literature on the role that status plays in structuring markets and determining organizational outcomes.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0183,"<p>Immanuel Maurice Wallerstein, born on 28 September 1930, is best known for having developed world-systems analysis, a macrohistorical approach to understanding capitalism. He first became interested in world affairs, particularly the anticolonial movement in India, as a teenager living in New York City. After serving in the US Army from 1951 to 1953, he wrote his MA thesis in the burgeoning subfield of political sociology, arguing that McCarthyism was only marginally against communism and, instead, was a program of the “practical right” against the “sophisticated conservatives.” His PhD thesis, however, was on the role of voluntary associations in nationalist movements in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. He won a Ford Foundation Fellowship to conduct his dissertation research in West Africa, working across linguistic barriers. In 1960, Wallerstein first met Frantz Fanon, who became an important and lasting influence on his work. In 1973, Wallerstein became president of the African Studies Association. As a result of his intellectual roots in Africana studies, national liberation, core-periphery relations, and critiques of Eurocentrism continue to be central concerns of his work. Wallerstein earned his BA (1951), MA (1954), and PhD (1959) from Columbia University, where he then joined the faculty. In 1968, he participated in and supported student protests against the university’s complicity in the Vietnam War. From 1971 to 1976, he taught at McGill University before joining the faculty at the State University of New York at Binghamton (SUNY Binghamton). At SUNY Binghamton, he founded the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations, one of the premier institutes supporting research in world-systems analysis. At the Fernand Braudel Center, he became founding editor of the journal Review, the first journal dedicated to world-systems research. In 1994–1995, he chaired the Gulbenkian Commission, which endeavored to break down the disciplinary boundaries among the historical social sciences. He remained at SUNY Binghamton until his retirement in 1999 and since 2000 was Senior Research Scholar at Yale University. Wallerstein died on 31 August 2019 at his home in Branford, CT.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0167,"<p>In an increasingly global world with significant cross-border migration, societies inevitably contain people with different ethnic, cultural, and religious identities. In the context of the United States in particular, the presence of ethnic, cultural, and religious heterogeneity is more commonly referred to as diversity, while in most other contexts the mere presence of such heterogeneity is dubbed multiculturalism—the most general formulation of multiculturalism in sociology. However, multiculturalism is also an ideological position founded upon the claim that minority identities are important to the people who hold them, and that the identity groups they create will persist. Because identity and identity groups matter, they must be recognized and accommodated in social and political life. Generally speaking, the sociology of multiculturalism falls into six broad categories: the study of growing population diversity, commonly referred to as demographic multiculturalism; multicultural theory; multicultural policy; the impact of multiculturalism; the retreat from multiculturalism; and examination of multiculturalism as a cultural object. Due to its broad subject matter—recent and contemporary cultural diversity and the changes it has wrought in societies and nations—the study of multiculturalism is particularly interdisciplinary. The sociology of multiculturalism overlaps many other areas of research in sociology: migration and immigrant inclusion, national identity and citizenship, religious studies, and racial and ethnic studies, just to name a few. Multiculturalism is also a common subject in the fields of education, political science, philosophy, cultural studies, and history. This article focuses almost exclusively on work that is done in sociology and by sociologists. In addition, the sociology of multiculturalism is, most especially, an international field of research.</p>",sociology
10.1332/policypress/9781447346166.003.0001,"<p>This introductory chapter provides an overview of sexism in sociology. In much sociology, women as a social group are invisible or inadequately represented: they take the insubstantial form of ghosts, shadows, or stereotyped characters. This issue of sexism has a direct relevance to the main topic of this book: a survey of housewives and their attitudes to housework which was carried out in London in 1971. The conventional sociological approach to housework could be termed ‘sexist’: it has treated housework merely as an aspect of the feminine role in the family — as a part of women's role in marriage, or as a dimension of child-rearing — not as a work role. This book thus departs from sociological tradition and takes a new approach to women's domestic situation by looking at housework as a job and seeing it as work, analogous to any other kind of work in modern society.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0138,"<p>Gender stratification refers to the social ranking, where men typically inhabit higher statuses than women. Often the terms gender inequality and gender stratification are used interchangeably. There are a variety of approaches to the study of gender stratification. Most of the research in this area focuses on differences between men’s and women’s life circumstances, broadly defined. Scholarly debates focus on which dimensions of inequalities are most relevant and the level at which inequalities are generated and maintained (i.e., individual, couple, family, group, or societal level). Researchers have been challenged to explore gender, race, and class inequalities from an intersectional perspective, rather than treating gender as independent of race and class. There is little acknowledgment of the heteronormativity that is present in gender stratification research. Perhaps that will change once data regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression becomes more widely available. In this section, we present key areas of gender stratification research. Gender stratification can be examined at the level of individual outcomes and interactions or with a macro perspective that compares indexes of gender inequalities across countries. Although welfare states research examines many aspects within and across societies, it provides important insights in how state policies can shape patterns of gender stratification. Gender inequality in the area of education, economic resources, and family are closely linked in individuals’ lives, but distinct strands of research have emerged and will be discussed separately. Although we provide examples of research noting gendered health disparities are outcomes of gender inequalities within societies, not all health research makes this connection. Research on crime as well as migration and citizenship has traditionally focused on men. Yet a recent shift to include women more explicitly and gender more broadly has great potential to inform other areas of research on gender stratification.</p>",sociology

Usually supported in research institutions as a core component of the discipline of sociology, social theory most commonly encompasses the range of explanatory concepts, analytical tools, and heuristic devices on which sociologists and social scientists draw in their efforts to interpret statistical or qualitative data about particular empirical social phenomena. Social theory in this relatively narrowly delimited sense is usually thought of as more or less synonymous with the term “sociological theory.” But many common understandings of the scope of the field also imply a wider range of reference than this. Social theory can name general sources of ideas about social phenomena relevant to other disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, such as anthropology, political science, economics, history, cultural and media studies, and gender studies. And social theory can also be thought of as incorporating normative concerns bearing on debates about desirable ends or values of social life—about how social life ideally “ought to be”—in ways that overlap closely with concerns in the fields of moral, political, and legal philosophy. As social theory in most of its central concerns names only a practice of systematic theoretical thinking relevant to particular substantive problems or questions in sociology and other social-science disciplines, some headings in this bibliographical survey of the field will be found to overlap thematically with other Oxford Bibliographies entries in sociology. For more detailed surveys of substantive areas in the Oxford Bibliographies listing with prominent theoretical components see especially: Comparative Historical Sociology, Chicago School of Sociology, World-Systems Analysis, Marxist Sociology, Feminist Theory, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Postmodernity, Symbolic Interactionism, and Michel Foucault. The emphasis of the survey that follows falls primarily on currents and schools of thought in Western social theory from the 18th century to the present day.

The paper distinguishes between<jats:italic>Canadian Sociology</jats:italic>and the<jats:italic>Sociology of Canada</jats:italic>. The former involves the explanatory stance that one takes to understanding Canada. The latter addresses the significant social dimensions that underlie Canadian social organization, culture, and behavior. I make a case for a<jats:italic>Canadian Sociology</jats:italic>that focuses on the unique features of Canadian society rather than adopting a comparative perspective. I also argue that there is a continuing need within the<jats:italic>Sociology of Canada</jats:italic>to address the issues of staples development. However, I argue that “new” staples analysis must have a directional change from that of the past, in that social processes now largely determine the pattern of staples development. Moreover, new staples analysis must include issues that were never part of earlier staples analysis, such as issues of environmental impacts and of staples depletion under conditions, such as climate change. The paper concludes by analyzing four factors that provide the dominant social contexts for analyzing modern staples development: (1) the rise of neoliberal government, (2) the implementation of globalization and its social consequences, (3) the assumption of aboriginal rights and entitlement, and (4) the rise of environmentalism. These factors were generally not considered in earlier staples approaches. They are critical to understanding the role of staples development and its impact on Canada in the present time.Cet article est une version quelque peu révisé du cours pour le “prix pour contributions exceptionnelles” de l'auteur, présenté à la réunion annuelle de la Société Canadienne de Sociologie à Victoria, Colombie‐Britannique le 6 juin 2013.

Le dernier adresse les importantes dimensions sociales qui sous‐tendent l'organisation sociale, culturelle et comportementale. Je soutiendrai une sociologie canadienne qui se concentre sur les aspects uniques de la société canadienne au lieu d'adopter une perspective comparative. Je soutiendrai aussi qu'il existe un besoin continu au sein de la sociologie du Canada pour adresser les questions de la théorie des principales ressources. Cependant, je soutiens que l'analyse des principales ressources “nouvelle” nécessite un changement de direction que celles du passé, en ce que les processus sociaux déterminent principalement le système de développement des principales ressources. De plus, l'analyse des principales ressources “nouveau” doit inclure les problèmes qui n’étaient jamais partis des analyses précédentes, comme les problèmes d'impacts environnementaux et de la diminution des principales ressources dans les conditions comme celui des changements climatiques. Cet article ce termine par scruter quatre facteurs qui produisent le contexte social dominant dans les analyses du développement des principales ressources moderne: (1) la croissance du gouvernement néolibéral; (2) l'implémentation de la globalisation et ses conséquences sociales ; (3) l'assomption des droits autochtones, et (4) l'ascension d'environnementalisme.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0125,"<p>Ethnicity, and its sibling concept race, lies close to the center of sociological concern. Together these intertwining ideas constitute one of the driving forces in human affairs. Alongside class and gender, ethnicity and race amount to one of the primary axes of sociological analysis. Ethnicity and race have been especially prominent in sociological, political, anthropological, and historical analyses of the United States, but they also exist in every part of the world in local forms. Ethnicity and race are not quite the same thing, but they are intimately related, so their relationship, and the history of ideas about them, bears contemplating. The common view of both scientists and the general public for most of the last two centuries was that humankind is naturally divided up into four or five big races: white, black, yellow, red (and sometimes brown). Each was identified with origins in a different part of the globe: Europe, Africa, East Asia, the Americas (and sometimes the Malay Peninsula and island Southeast Asia). It was posited that each of these races constituted a separate type of people that could easily be distinguished from the others both by physical features and at the genetic level. Until the last few generations, scholars and the public presumed that each race also had a particular personality type, intelligence level, potential for achievement, and natural place in the social order. In the view common at that time, ethnic groups were seen as subgroups of races, marked off more by culture than by genetics. The European or white race included Swedes, Italians, Poles, Scots, and so on. The Asian or yellow race comprised Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, Pakistanis, and so on. The black or African race was made up of Ibo, Yoruba, San, Fulani, Bambara, Mandinka, and a host of other ethnic peoples. The common view was that race was about biology, but ethnicity was about culture and consent. One could not change one’s race, but one’s ethnicity was partly subject to choice. Certainly, in that view, ethnicity was a matter more of behavior than of biology. To be sure, mostly Muslim Pakistanis had different religious ways, foodways, languages, and child-rearing practices than did mostly Buddhist Koreans. Yet it was hard to deny that people from Korea also didn’t look very much like people from Pakistan. And it could not be denied that one could talk meaningfully about black culture in the United States or Britain. So as more and more people came into contact with people from different parts of the world, it became harder and harder to sustain the notion that races were big, permanent, and easily definable, and that racial boundaries were decided on a physical or biological basis, while ethnic groups were smaller subsidiary groups whose differences were cultural and mutable. Over the course of the 20th century, the notion of biologically separated races and culturally separated ethnic groups gradually gave way to a view of humankind as a single field of infinite variety, with one population shading, physically and culturally, into the next almost imperceptibly as one moved across the globe. Scholars and some of the public became aware that, whether one considered genotype or phenotype, the differences between the so-called races were really very small—much smaller than the biological similarities between them. And the physical differences between ethnic groups could be quite large—the average Pakistani does not look much like the average Korean; the average Norwegian does not look much like the average Italian. In the past few decades scholars have almost entirely eschewed the notion of races as longstanding, biologically discrete categories. Instead, they have emphasized that racial ideas were constructed by historical actors, in particular times and places we can identify, for reasons at which we can make at least educated guesses. Constructedness and contingency are at the core of our understanding of ethnicity and race in the 21st century. We have come to see race and ethnicity as processes more than categories. Many sociologists speak of racialization: a process by which one set of people writes a story of essential, indelible difference (and frequently inferiority) onto another set of people. Some people think of the differences between groups as ethnic—that is, as primarily cultural—until the racial moment, when someone imputes to those differences a primordial, indelible quality, and racialization occurs. Yet the residue of the earlier, biologistic view of race as something physical and indelible, but ethnicity as something cultural and malleable, still lurks beneath the surface, shaping the perceptions and actions of the general public and of more than a few social scientists. Though race is now seen as a socially constructed category, not a biological essence, race and ethnicity nonetheless operate powerfully to shape the life chances of individuals. Some people’s life chances are significantly greater than other people’s on account of the races, religions, or ethnic groups to which they are assigned. People kill people because of their race or their ethnicity—whether in Nazi Germany or the American South or the Balkans of the 1990s. The fact that race and ethnicity are social constructions rather than biologically based facts does not mean that they do not have powerful real-life consequences. This bibliography does not include studies of specific ethnic and racial groups, except in a few cases where particular group studies were classic markers in the development of the field of ethnic and racial studies. Researchers should look to other, group-specific Oxford Bibliographies Online for such studies of individual groups.</p>",sociology

These variations are diverse and innate. Intersex human rights defenders and human rights institutions challenge the stigma and discrimination that intersex people face because of their physical variations, but few jurisdictions so far have tackled the human rights violations that intersex people suffer. There are multiple additional, contested, and incommensurate lenses through which intersex people are viewed. These express different values and beliefs about the same people, including their meaning, treatment, concerns, and demands. Medical lenses view intersex traits as “disorders of sex development” (DSD), and people with those traits are viewed as female or male and subjects for treatment. Anthropology and queer and gender studies have viewed intersex as an illustration of fallacies that underpin subjective cultural norms for sex and gender. Law increasingly views intersex people as members of a third sex. Historical research shows that intersex people, often termed hermaphrodites, have always existed, and often been accommodated.</p>",sociology
10.1177/003803857901300102,"The theme of this paper is that the content, form, location and social role of utopia vary with the material conditions in which people live. These variations have been obscured by definitions of utopia in terms of its function in catalysing social change, which has also produced the illusion that the contemporary Western world lacks utopias. By defining utopia with reference to its meaning to author and audience as an expression of their desires and aspirations, it is possible to trace a series of shifts in the English utopia, to relate these to one another and to the social context, and to show that the `absence' of contemporary utopias is simply another transformation of this kind. From being a spatially-located wish-fantasy, utopia moved through the function of social criticism to being a temporally-located catalyst of social change. These changes depended on perceptions of society-in-time as increasingly malleable and open to human control, culminating in the nineteenth century belief in progress. Utopia now appears to have reverted to the role of wish-fantasy as a result of a prevalent fatalism and a shift away from an evolutionary perspective, a change which, paradoxically, allows it to be more utopian by tying it less closely to reality. Utopia as a catalyst of social change depends on an optimism which is now absent.",sociology

What follows allows only for a sketch of the framework; I have published fuller theoretical, methodological and policy-related accounts elsewhere. Anti-reductionist sociology is a sensitising theoretical perspective, not a body of substantive theory. This differentiation has an affinity with Mouzelis's (1993:684) distinction between methodological generalisations and substantive generalisations, the present paper being concerned with the former. In Cohen's terminology (1987:279-80) the approach outlined in the paper is ontologically flexible and in some sense electic: while explicitly excluding reductionist, essentialist, reified and teleological formulations, anti-reductionist sociology is a synthetic metatheoretical framework designed to encourage the development of substantive theories that are not necessarily tied to any particular paradigm.",sociology

               This chapter critically reviews work of three representatives of the French tradition of psychologically informed sociology: Marcel Mauss, Pierre Bourdieu, and Loïc Wacquant. It considers both the institutional backgrounds to these scholars’ encounters with psychology and cognitive science and main aspects of the conceptual and methodological evolution that has occurred between Mauss and Wacquant, particularly as regards their use of the habitus concept. Finally, it considers the influence of French psychological sociology on contemporary cognitive sociology, surveying some of the theoretical and methodological innovations that have resulted as well as possible avenues for further development of these interdisciplinary fields.",sociology
10.1177/0038038585019004005,"In the light of the recent growth of artificial intelligence (AI), and of its implications for understanding human behaviour, this paper evaluates the prospects for an association between sociology and artificial intelligence. Current presumptions about the distinction between human behaviour and artificial intelligence are identified through a survey of discussions about AI and `expert systems'. These discussions exhibit a restricted view of sociological competence, a marked rhetoric of progress and a wide variation in assessments of the state of the art. By drawing upon recent themes in the social study of science, these discussions are shown to depend on certain key dichotomies and on an interpretive flexibility associated with the notions of intelligence and expertise. The range of possible associations between sociology and AI reflects the extent to which we are willing to adopt these features of AI discourse. It is suggested that one of the more important options is to view the AI phenomenon as an occasion for reassessing the central axiom of sociology that there is something distinctively `social' about human behaviour.",sociology

Sexuality studies are interdisciplinary and include work from anthropology, gender and women’s studies, history, LGBT studies, psychology, queer studies, and sociology. The social study of sexuality contrasts with biological approaches to human sexuality, which frame sexual expression as resulting from anatomy and hormones. Contemporary social approaches to studying sexualities—the focus of this article—took shape during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when sociologists, feminists, and gay liberationists argued that sexuality (desire, orientation) was not innate, but socially constructed. Thus, contemporary research and theory operates under the assumption that sexual desires, identities, and behaviors are socially constructed. Sexuality studies seek to explain how social institutions and social interaction patterns shape sexual meanings and practices. A significant portion of sexualities work focuses on inequalities between genders, between heterosexuals and nonheterosexuals (of which there are an expanding array of identities, particularly as gender identities expand), races and ethnicities, and social classes.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0115,"<p>Social revolutions are typically conceived as transformative historical events that fundamentally change the social structures of society. Their outcomes, as such, are usually associated with the transition to modernity, the rise of capitalism, and the emergence of democracy. It is their transformative effect, despite similarities, that sets them apart from rebellions, revolts, political revolutions, and other types of social movements, making them rare events in history. Compared to political revolutions, which are typically orchestrated from above, social revolutions are mass based. Their root causes are structural in nature, and the processes associated with their mass mobilization typically involve cultural, psychological, and political factors. The systematic social scientific study of revolutions may be traced back to the 19th century. These early works accounted for the structural causes and social forces behind them. Some project a concern with the deleterious effects of revolutionary dynamics. In the context of 20th-century history, the events that followed the Russian Revolution spurred academic interest on this complex sociopolitical phenomenon. The first generation of scholarship on revolution may be identified as the “Natural History School.” Scholars writing in this vein in the 1930s identified common historical patterns through which the American, English, French, and Russian Revolutions unfolded. In this perspective, revolutions emerge as a “natural” historical outcome of old regime practices, and their outbreaks follow a sequence of historical events that culminate in the establishment of a new regime. Second-generation theorists writing in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s focused on psychological factors, in particular expectation and frustration mechanisms. Scholars belonging to this generation also paid attention to the effects of institutional imbalance (or systemic pathology) on the potential for revolution. Third-generation scholars, primarily writing in the 1970s and 1980s, developed structural explanations of revolution, claiming that the key to making sense of the causes of revolution requires the student of revolution to consider the nature of “state breakdown” and the revolutionary potential of lower classes. Scholars belonging to this generation also paid attention to the political processes in the development of revolution. Fourth-generation scholars aimed to highlight agency in their analyses, although not at the expense of structural explanations. These scholars, writing since the 1990s, have more concretely examined the role played by culture and ideology, the structural features of gender and race, and increasingly the emotional and storytelling dimensions of revolutionary processes. Since this last generation of scholars’ focus on cultural and structural factors, more recent work has increasingly paid attention to the connections between globalization and revolution.</p>",sociology

Caste groups are unequal, ranked on a scale of hierarchy on the basis of their ritual status, from pure to impure. The hierarchy is sanctioned by the Hindu religious belief.

Systems of social categorization are virtually always associated with differential, unequal resources. Intersectionality is a concept fundamental to understanding these societal inequalities; the key assertion of intersectionality is that the various systems of societal oppression do not act independently of each other. Different systems of inequality are transformed in their intersections, the fundamental principle of intersectionality. The phrase “race, class, and gender,” still in use, is a precursor of the concept of intersectionality. The preferred use of the latter term reflects in part the awareness that there are more than three intersecting systems of societal inequalities. The metaphors noted in the section Metaphors of Intersectionality below have been powerful visualizations of this complexity. Further, some identities may be privileged categories, others marginalized. Thus oppression and privilege may be experienced simultaneously, complicating the analysis of inequality. These issues are addressed in the section Critiques of Intersectionality below. Intersectionality crosses levels of analysis, from the micro-level experiences of individual actors to the macro-level structural, organizational, and institutional contexts in which human interactions and experiences are formed. Intersectionality is an analytic approach, a way of thinking about social categories that articulates similarity and difference, always inflected by relations of power. Research adopting an intersectional lens falls into several not entirely distinct groups: theoretical and methodological debates, evident in the sections Organizational Frameworks of Intersectionality and Methodologies, and applications of intersectional dynamics and political interventions, evident in the sections Intersectional Praxis and Transnational Intersectionalities. Intersectionality is also a deeply interdisciplinary concept, an analytic approach that can be found in almost all of the social sciences as well as the humanities; examples here are drawn from political science and psychology, in addition to the sociological examples appropriate to this series.</p>",sociology

This doctrine typically regards one’s own race as superior to other races. Intergroup hatred and discrimination generally accompanies racist doctrines. Social science investigates racism at three interrelated levels. First, individual racism involves those individuals who hold racist beliefs. Here racist ideas often overlap with such concepts as prejudice, xenophobia, bigotry, and intolerance. But the key distinguishing feature of individual racism is that the group differences are viewed as innate and unchangeable. If assimilation or conversion is viewed as possible, then intolerance is involved but not racism. Second, situational racism occurs when racist behavior is shaped by the social context. This occurs when face-to-face situations are patterned, based on racist beliefs, to place one group in an inferior position in intergroup interaction. This occurs, for example, when one racial group in a situation possesses most of the resources that emphasize the status differences between the groups. Finally, third, structural and cultural racism results when a society’s institutions are shaped by racist beliefs and results in group discrimination. Indeed, racism’s effects can invade virtually all of a society’s institutions. Thus, racism differentiates human beings from one another by presumed “races,” and this leads to unequal access to resources and opportunities as well as to other forms of inequality such as gender-, ethnic-, and class-based inequity. Much of the research on racism has focused on anti-Black racism in the United States; but non-American references with other racist targets are included.</p>",sociology

It then presents examples of work in historical social science that have come closest to the requirements of analytical sociology.

The article proposes a synthetic analysis of this change, starting with statistical data on the migration of populations from the poorest countries on Earth to the richest ones. The analysis focuses on what is happening in the vast area of the Mediterranean. The history of the Mediterranean, this is the hypothesis put forward in the article, could help us to reflect innovatively on the demographic and cultural dynamics that are taking place in a particularly significant way. The reason for which it is hypothesized that the Mediterranean could be the privileged social place where we can reflect on the metamorphosis we are experiencing lies in the long tradition of welcoming diversity and in the capacity for the coexistence of religions, cultures, and civilizations that, over the centuries, have been the force thanks to which the whole world has been dominated, despite the clashes that historiography has unquestionably shown us. The article shows the important commitment of the leaders of the different world religions in generating spaces for encounters and dialogue between cultural diversities that cannot be analyzed within the paradigm of confrontation but require to be understood within the paradigm of confrontation and responsible coexistence. The work done so far clearly shows the possibility of dialogue between diversities, as well as pointing the way forward to socialize all different cultures to be together, without clashing for dominance; in this task, the reflections of Pope Francis and Edgar Morin on the concepts of brotherhood and fraternity appear particularly useful.",sociology

A closely related concept, “childhood,” refers to the life stage of these individuals. During the middle of the 20th century, sociologists generally were not focused on studying children, leaving that field to psychologists, who often studied children from the perspective of developmental psychology. Subsequently, three major streams of sociological thought began to develop. The first looked at how child development was conditioned by both historical and social circumstances. The second studied how children created their own worlds and were themselves active agents, rather than passive recipients of socialization. The third highlighted the importance of societal and family investment in children. For many researchers, scholarship from psychology, economics, and demography was combined with insights from sociology to provide new information on child well-being. As a consequence, several categories for entries in this article overlap conceptually. This means that entries logically could be listed under other subheadings or duplicated across these categories.

Discrimination has been addressed by a wide range of disciplines as an explanatory object—including sociology, anthropology, political science, psychology, economics, and law—all seeking to shed light on why discrimination occurs and what conditions give rise to and reproduce its practice. What distinguishes a sociological approach to discrimination as an explanatory object from that in other disciplines, namely psychology or economics, is its insistence on looking at the macro level of analysis, explaining the phenomenon as a result of social processes not necessarily reducible to individual-level preferences or cognitive processes. Sociologists have also addressed discrimination as an explanation for an observed phenomenon of interest, namely social stratification: the unequal distribution of status, material benefits, and political rights.</p>",sociology

It bears the potential to reconnect the sociological discourse with the classical ‘big’ questions that haunted sociology for an entire century. But for shaping the global agenda of sociology, this essay argues, the sociological discourse in India first had to deconstruct its alter ego. Overcoming the reception of western sociology as a monolithic construct will remove an intellectual obstacle. This leitmotiv is discussed by reflecting on three recent books, by Yogesh Atal, T. K. Oommen and Yogendra Singh, which analyse the development of Indian sociology as a ‘locus of struggles’ (Bourdieu): Where did it come from? How does it operate? Where will it go? While tracing its evolution and interaction with western sociological discourse, the essay first discusses the introduction of social sciences to India as a colonial heritage that implanted empiricist ‘outsider ’ studies of ‘native’ cultures, and identifies the reception of the American siblings of structural-functionalism and empiricism that dominated western sociology in the 1960s. Both intellectual encounters provoked the traditionalist call for indigenization as a counterforce to the perceived westernization of Indian social thought from 1950 to 1980. Finally, considering the recent attempt of a perspective ‘from below’, the essay discusses how far the view that places the increasing exclusion of specific groups from the public discourse on the sociological agenda could unite Indian sociology — and decentre the global one.",sociology

A willingness to tackle the dimension of space and the thorny problems it raises often sets rural sociologists apart from other sociologists. This research tradition contrasted with general sociology's concern with developing generalization, aspatial covering laws, and proto‐typical relationships of modern or Fordist development settings. Conceptual openings have left sociologists questioning their past agenda.

The list includes psychologists (e.g., social, developmental, clinical, cognitive, counseling), sociologists, anthropologists, and health scientists. Different disciplines employ various approaches to address relationships. For instance, social psychologists seek universal properties in human relations. Sociologists, on the other hand, pay much attention to changes in family ties and social connections and how social structures and contexts (e.g., social class, race, gender, norms, and social policy) impact these relationships. Relationships have been a central research concern in sociology. Sociologists have been particularly interested in studies of intimate relationships, such as marriage and other familial ties. In sociology, social relationships are divided into primary and secondary groups. Primary ties are characterized by direct, personal, and intimate interactions. In addition, primary group members exchange tacit items such as support, love, and concern. Examples of these would be family ties and close friends. Secondary social groups, on the other hand, such as political parties and trade unions, are usually impersonal and instrumental and are formed to fulfill special interests.

Popular culture is usually associated with either mass culture or folk culture, and differentiated from high culture and various institutional cultures (political culture, educational culture, legal culture, etc.). The association of popular culture with mass culture leads to a focus on the position of popular culture within a capitalist mode of economic production. Through this economic lens, popular culture is seen as a set of commodities produced through capitalistic processes driven by a profit motive and sold to consumers. In contrast, the association of popular culture with folk culture leads to a focus on subcultures such as youth cultures or ethnic cultures.

Holistic approaches examine the ways that popular culture begins as the collective creation of a subculture and is then appropriated by the market system.

The only child of a peasant sharecropper turned postman, he left his region on the recommendation of a high school teacher to pursue an elite academic curriculum in Paris. He graduated from the prestigious École Normale Supérieure, then at the apex of French academic life. There he studied philosophy. He concentrated on epistemology and on the history of science, which set him against the then dominant current, existentialism, personified by Jean-Paul Sartre. Bourdieu’s vocation in philosophy shifted abruptly to the social sciences after he was drafted into the French army and sent to Algeria at the height of its Liberation War (1956–1962). There he turned to empirical inquiry, carrying out both ethnographic and statistical studies of colonial transformation, as well as absorbing the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss. Upon his return to France, Bourdieu completed his conversion to sociology: he became Director of Studies at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris (1964); he founded a research center (1968), launched a journal (Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales, 1975), and assembled a research team focusing on symbolic power, and social inequality in their broadest manifestations. After the 1970s, Bourdieu tackled an increasingly diverse set of empirical topics (spanning art, ritual, kinship, religion, science, intellectuals, language, social classes, and political institutions, inter alia) while developing his own paradigm, seeking a pathway out of the opposition between structuralist objectivism and constructivist subjectivism—first proposed in Outline of a Theory of Practice. He then honed his distinctive conceptual triad of habitus, capital, and field in Distinction (1984) before he was elected to the Collège de France in 1982, where his research expanded to encompass the state, gender domination, the social foundations of the economy, and the experience of social suffering in contemporary society. Bourdieu addressed salient social issues, as in The Weight of the World (1999), and deepened his rethinking of the distinctive logic of practice and the epistemological dilemmas of social inquiry in Pascalian Meditations (2000). He became a leading public figure in the global mobilization against neoliberalism, while his work gained international influence across the social sciences and the humanities.

Due to technological and legal changes there is more and more variation among mothers with respect to age, marital status, and sexual orientation. Adoption has long shown that social motherhood is not contingent on giving birth, and surrogacy and in vitro fertilization now create a possible distinction between the gestational mother and the genetic mother. As a result, the very definition of who is a mother can be contentious. The very process of conception, pregnancy, and birthing has undergone much transition, with much greater involvement of medical professionals. The meanings associated with motherhood and motherhood practices vary across historical, sociocultural, and political contexts. Despite the great variation, even within specific countries at one point in time in the practices of motherhood, discourses about what exactly constitutes “good” mothering and who should and should not mother exist. Those at the “frontier” of motherhood, such as queer mothers, continue to shape and reshape the very concept of motherhood and mothering. For many mothers this means they are caught between cultural expectations on how to mother and the realities of their everyday life: for example, breastfeeding practices and childcare arrangements. Although rates of mothers’ labor-force participation are high or increasing in many countries, mothers still face the primary burden of arranging, managing, and even financing childcare solutions for their children; work-family conflict remains a problem for mothers much more so than for fathers. Polices designed to ease the conflict between employment and motherhood, both those implemented by governments and those created by employers, vary greatly across countries, which reemphasizes the context dependency of the meaning of motherhood for women’s lives. Many aspects of research on motherhood suggest that motherhood, and especially the link between motherhood and employment continues to be an important component of persistent gender inequality. In addition to contributing to inequalities between men and women, and between women within any given society, motherhood also contributes to global inequality (through the transnational market for care workers), international adoptions, and international surrogacy.</p>",sociology

Simply put, social stratification is the allocation of individuals and groups according to various social hierarchies of differing power, status, or prestige. Although divisions are often based on gender, religion, or race and ethnicity, the present entry focuses largely on socioeconomic inequalities, for the most part leaving other forms of social inequality to other entries. In this regard, social stratification is found in every society, even if it takes on slightly different forms. Uncovering what accounts for differences in social stratification—among societies and within particular societies over time—is a long-standing goal of the field. The classic works of early stratification sociologists—spurred by the work of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim—tended to be concerned with the question of “why” and “how” stratification arose in the first place. Although this debate continues to be an underlying motivation for much research on stratification, empirical research typically tackles questions for which evidence is more tangible. By the 1950s, stratification research was increasingly concerned with social mobility, though mostly within individual countries. By the 1980s, explaining cross-national differences in stratification became an important goal of the field. By now, stratification research is characterized by several debates. Although it has received somewhat less attention in the past decade or so, a classic debate centers on how socioeconomic position should be measured. Emphasis here has been on the applicability of measures of social class, status, and prestige. Although there are certainly important exceptions, differences in approach generally fall along territorial lines. European sociologists have tended to focus on relevance of occupation-based measures of social class, while North American sociologists have tended to rely on measures of socioeconomic status, which incorporate education as well as occupation. There have also been debates regarding the most effective ways to measure class and socioeconomic status.

Finally, in recent decades emphasis has moved to the importance of education, both as a source of stratification on its own, and how it affects economic inequalities.</p>",sociology

While there is much consternation in the popular press about globalization generally and economic globalization specifically that suggests that something new and never before seen is taking place, social scientists across a handful of decades offer a more tempered view, depicting a functionally integrated global economy as an historical thing that nonetheless transforms and develops over time. The rich literature that has developed on this topic draws the readers’ attention to particular historical times and processes that constitute the early formations of the global economy we know today, even as its size and scope has intensified in recent decades. In this vein, scholars have devoted much attention to specifying the key indicators of economic globalization including—to name just a few— trade, global commodity chains, foreign direct investment, and financialization. All of these processes are the means by which economies are globally interwoven through the production, distribution, and circulation of goods, information, money, culture, and people. A similar amount of scholarly attention has examined the outcomes of economic globalization, and how they vary for different actors. Here inequalities of resources and power are central focal points, including those within and among nations, between capital and labor, and within the world-system hierarchy. The impact of economic globalization on marginalized people and places, as demarcated by gender, race, migration status, and environmental locations, as well as on nation-states and their capacity to govern effectively, are also topics of much interest. Finally, scholars have examined the many important issues related to the governance and regulation of economic globalization, which as a set of processes is occurring at a higher level than the nation-state and includes an ever-shifting balance of power between a number of actors and institutional bodies. International organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, are examples of quasi-governmental organizational bodies, though of varied effectiveness, as are international financial institutions. Finally corporate regulation in the global economy remains scarce, although recently corporate social responsibility initiatives have begun to be investigated and evaluated as a type of self-regulation. Although economic globalization is nothing if not hotly contested subject matter, scholarly research provides an exciting conversation, mapped here through its origins, its contemporary state and constituent elements, its differential outcomes for various actors, and the problems and possibilities of its governance.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0270,"<p>This collection of studies brings together research covering different forms of economic inequality as they exist in a cross-national perspective. Existing work in this area examines income disparities between countries (often characterized by the familiar North-South gap in development), as well as the distribution of income within countries (as is often summarized by the Kuznets Curve or the Great U-Turn). Some of this work is descriptive, examining how levels of development or inequality vary across countries and/or how these levels change over time. Much of it, however, attempts to identify causal factors that contribute to a country’s economic growth, underdevelopment, or changes in its income distribution. Scholars develop models that either focus on internal conditions (institutions, geography, state policy) or external forces (different forms of economic globalization, including international trade, foreign investment, and aid). There has been considerable debate among scholars as to whether income differences between countries are narrowing (i.e., the convergence literature) or not. Less attention is given to whether income distributions among countries are becoming more similar (convergence in inequality levels). In addition, some scholars combine these two pieces of information (i.e., inequality between and within countries) to study world income inequality, with a similar emphasis on description; causal explanation (examining internal and external factors); and debate over whether or not convergence is occurring. Related work examines how national income inequality influences economic growth, intergenerational mobility, poverty, health, violence, and human rights conditions. Theoretically, excessive inequality is thought to slow growth, hinder mobility, and concentrate a greater number of people below the poverty line. A number of scholars design empirical studies that test these assumptions, however, producing results that often confirm these assumptions, but that also offer qualifications to help nuance these arguments. Finally, scholars are now turning their attention to the distribution of wealth, a more immense type of inequality, but one that remains understudied due to the lack of data coverage across time and space. Although this line of research remains in its infancy, scholars should eventually be able to replicate the vast literature on income inequality with a research agenda focused entirely on the global distribution of wealth (and its components parts that exist within and between countries), as well as related work on intergenerational mobility and household poverty as it pertains to asset accumulation.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0099,"<p>Housework contributes to the broad project of social reproduction. Household labor perpetuates the social structures associated with family, gender, inequality and the labor force. Provisioning families and keeping up the household all fall under the general rubric of non-market labor, that is, the unpaid work that includes not only housework, but also caring for family members. Because this takes place outside public view and falls largely to women, the value of housework to families and society has often been overlooked or discounted. Until the middle of the 20th century, household labor received little scholarly attention outside the applied field of home economics. As female employment rates increased, however, men’s and women’s lives converged in the realm of paid work, raising questions about why change came more slowly to private households. Although men do more work around the house than their fathers did a generation ago, women still do the lion’s share, and some chores remain stubbornly stereotyped as “women’s work.” Indeed, the allocation of housework is a telling indicator of gender inequality in individual households and societies. Housework also reflects on class inequality, because high-income women can hire poor women to do the job. Domestic arrangements are the outcome of both micro-level family circumstances and macro-level cultural and structural forces. Gender attitudes, partners’ time constraints, their relative resources in bargaining over the chores, and the presence of children illustrate the micro-level influences on the volume and distribution of housework. Cross-national differences in domestic practices demonstrate that the characteristics of social institutions and social policies shape intimate domestic arrangements. How the housework is managed matters for marital relationships, personal well-being, individual careers and population processes. The demand for household labor has created a transnational labor force of domestic workers with implications for global inequality.</p>",sociology

As an academic discipline, social policy is distinct in its empirical focus on welfare provision but overlaps with other social science fields such as sociology, political science, and public administration. From a narrow standpoint, social policy refers to policies and practices created to address the needs of individuals, i.e., to provide welfare. From a broader standpoint, social policy can be used to motivate individual behavior; is inherently related to the creation of social inequalities across class, gender, race, and sexualities; and is closely tied to capital. Social policy encompasses a wide range of policies, including activation, care, education, families, health care, pensions/aging, poverty/social assistance, and unemployment. Social policy practice refers to the administration of social policies and service delivery. Welfare provision is not limited to government—markets, employers, nongovernmental organizations, churches, and informal networks all play a role in welfare provision, although this varies across countries. The focus, however, particularly in social policy research, is often on government policies and the provision of services. In particular, social policy is often discussed in relation to the welfare state because social policies represent the public or collective management of social risks, an essential function of welfare states. In recent years, social policy research has become increasingly comparative, with a focus on cross-national analyses of systems, policies, and service provision. I would like to thank Hannelore van Hoffen, my research assistant, for all her efforts in helping to compile a list of social policy references to be considered for this article.</p>",sociology

Methodologically, it privileges deep, immersive fieldwork alongside research participants. Substantively, it focuses on interactions and institutions that define urban space, whether those are public streets, neighborhood organizations, or community events. Urban ethnographies have traditionally thought of “communities” geographically, examining how the central topics of poverty, crime, culture, and peer group formation play out in delimited spaces such as neighborhoods, wards, and districts. Theoretically, it has historically tended to draw on social-constructionist and interactionist orientations, conceiving of the urban life as something “built up,” so to speak, from repeated and ritualized encounters. As one of the longest-standing and iconic subfields of sociology, anthropology, and other humanistic social sciences, urban ethnography remains one of the most influential modes of understanding social life in cities. True to form as one of the most conflictual and controversial subfields, an increasing number of scholars are pushing back on convention, insisting on the need to embrace theoretical orientations that are more critical and structurally focused, and to more adequately consider the global forces and relational dynamics that exist beyond, but fatefully impinge upon, bounded field sites. As urban ethnography’s readership has grown, so too have methodological critiques regarding replicability, as well as concerns about potential exploitation and voyeurism among its practitioners and readership.</p>",sociology

This distinguishes it from the `old sociology' that had not been able to free itself from `private' social values. It is argued that Mills' power elite and Gouldner's coming crisis theses provided the foundation for a common enterprise among many `new sociologists' to develop a critical and public sociology that would seek to shape what Mills called the `democratic society of publics'.`New sociologists' share a critique of modern societies, namely, that though most modern societies have formal democracies, a substantial democratic social structure of publics is often lacking, due to the erosion of the public sphere by private values.",sociology

10.1177/1468795x241296085,"Gregor McLennan sees my book as inaugurating a new phase of “multiplex” postcolonial sociology. This approach moves away from sweeping generalizations about Eurocentrism, Manicheaism, complicity, and pervasive coloniality in “Western” sociology. It pays closer attention to sociology’s internal heterogeneity and is less distrustful of scientific norms such as validity, objectivity, evidence, autonomy, scientific neutrality, and explanation. More specifically, my approach relies (1) on the idea of “context” from the classic sociology of knowledge and intellectual history; (2) on the concept of “field” from Bourdieu; (3) on methods of “close reading” and textual interpretation from literary criticism; and (4) on the “historians’ craft” (Bloch) of using the most extensive available archive of published and unpublished sources. I argue that we can evaluate historical thinkers in their contexts, assessing the constraints and spaces of possibility they faced, and then examine their intellectual choices, the moves they make in the social scientific game. This approach aligns more closely with the ideas of the founders of postcolonial theory, who were more interested in texts that “brush up unstintingly against historical constraints” rather than those that are “inertly of their time” (Edward Said). McLennan agrees that postcolonial sociology is indebted to European Enlightenment traditions; I focus on its roots in the sociology of knowledge and sociological historicism. The article then responds to McLennan’s main “probes.” The first concerns the methodological problem of “labeling investigations as ʽsociologyʼ and specific people as ʽsociologistsʼ”, and the limits of field theory. The second concerns my “outline of a theory of colonial sociological practice,” which tries to understand the dilemmas facing sociologists in colonial situations and the historians who study them. The third probe addresses the question of the scientific exploitation of empire. The sociologists I emphasize did not approach the colonized as a pool of resources to be extracted and exploited but worked across the colonial boundary line to generate knowledge. Although the book focuses on the mid-20th century, I return in my comments to Durkheim, upon whose shoulders so much of the later work was standing. The key is that Durkheim was also a theorist of empire and colonialism and politically an anticolonialist. He described colonies as anomic spaces and rejected biological concepts and hierarchical notions of civilization. He rejected universalistic values while advocating a system of states governed by historically specific morality and law rather than violence. Finally, Durkheim reversed the “imperial gaze,” directing it back at Europe.",sociology

This is now gradually coming into existence through an accumulation of recent or current studies, some directed towards theoretical research, others guided by more immediate practical considerations (such as the problems of town-planning).  In actual fact, urban sociology seems unlikely to develop, in France, into a specialized branch of sociology.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0166,"<p>Social Darwinism is a complex and controversial topic, a package of ideologies supposedly inspired by biological evolutionism that is of interest to scholars of both the life and the social sciences. In principle it includes any political system inspired by the view that human nature and social activity are driven by our biological nature, especially as defined by the process of evolution. The complexity of the topic derives from the fact that the term social Darwinism has been applied to a number of different (and to some extent incompatible) ideologies. The key feature is supposed to be the influence of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, in which the “struggle for existence” determines the “survival of the fittest,” thereby ensuring that the species adapts to new conditions—although it is widely assumed that the process also guarantees progress toward higher levels of complexity. The classic image is of the proponents of unrestrained free-enterprise capitalism justifying their policy by appealing to the “survival of the fittest.” But the term has also been applied to justifications of militarism and imperialism (national or racial struggle) and to the eugenics movement’s efforts to replace natural selection with a process of artificial selection by restricting the reproduction of the “unfit.” The term has also been applied to more or less any claim that human nature is fixed by hereditary factors, especially those linked to social class or race. The topic is contentious because social Darwinism is almost always used in a pejorative sense—the opponents of these ideologies use it to define positions they reject, and this becomes particularly sensitive when applied to areas such as Nazi racial policies and the Holocaust. Most forms of social Darwinism are associated with right-wing ideologies, despite the fact that scholars can point to many left-wing writers who were also inspired by Darwin. The problem of interpretation is compounded by the fact that historians of both the biological and the social sciences are involved, bringing very different interpretive frameworks to bear. Scholars interested in the social world tend to equate social Darwinism with any ideology based on the struggle for existence, whether or not there is evidence of inspiration from biological Darwinism. Historians of science may be well aware that the term refers to a much wider range of ideologies than those inspired directly by Darwin, but they do expect the analysis to respect the fact that other biological ideas and, indeed, other evolutionary mechanisms were involved.</p>",sociology

Growth interests, it argues, especially dominate in countries like the United States, where land and buildings operate as private markets, rather than held in common by government or some other entity; most studies have been US based but many commentaries and analyses have followed on from research elsewhere. Researchers describe pursuit of growth in payrolls, capital spending, or construction activity. As in the classic Marxian framework, such would enhance “exchange value.” In the political sphere, growth interests form up at nested scales where they pressure for advantageous zoning and public infrastructure investments at relevant administrative levels—in roads, sewer lines, and so forth. They lobby and help finance campaigns. Opposition forms up, in turn, from those whose interest in the city is primarily for home life or shared enhancements—represented by civic groups or, increasingly, environmental organizations. They strive for gains, again from the extended Marxian lexicon, in “use value”—substantive public benefits, as in health care, libraries, schools, safety, and parks.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0233,"<p>As communication technologies develop and as organizations create policies to deal with global expansion and work−life balance, work practices and organizational lives have shifted, giving rise to a model of work where employment is not restricted to one particular place or to standard work hours. This model, workplace flexibility, has been the topic of many fields including sociology, organizational psychology, industry relations, gender studies, management, and health research. This article brings together influential studies from these fields and identifies key themes and topics of interest: the institutional and organizational forces that drive demand for workplace flexibility, types and practices of flexibility, disparities in the provision, access to, and usage of flexibility, the impact of flexibility on work-, family-, and health-related outcomes, and variation in these outcomes by workers’ characteristics and across contexts. Only articles published in English are included, but great efforts have been made to include as many international and cross-national studies as possible. As will be seen, research findings on workplace flexibility are not always consistent. Indeed, despite a growing literature that praises work flexibility for accommodating employees’ needs to balance work, leisure, and family and for reducing gender inequalities, there are also studies criticizing flexibility for fueling heightened job demands and job insecurity and for enlarging gender inequalities. This contradiction can be partially addressed by realizing that researchers do not always define “workplace flexibility” in the same way (see more discussion in Types of Workplace Flexibility). Unless noted otherwise, this article defines workplace flexibility as the ability of workers to make choices regarding when, where, and for how long they engage in work-related tasks. Flexible work arrangements, therefore, are organizational practices that permit employees to adjust their work schedule or location to better manage demands outside of work. Rigorous studies—through group-randomized trials or natural experiments—show that flexibility can promote employer and employee outcomes, but only through a systematic cultural change in how work is defined and how workers are rewarded. Given the still prevalent ideal worker norms that expect workers to be highly dedicated to work and that use “time at work” as the sole metric to assess productivity, a more profound change is needed to remove the stigma around flexibility so as to provide viable solutions to contemporary employees’ needs.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0121,"<p>Conversation analysis (hereafter CA) is a rigorously empirical approach to the investigation of social action—or “talk-in-interaction,” to employ the term which has been adopted as the preferred description of the field—which has emerged in the last five decades as the distinctive research program within the wider ethnomethodological perspective. The core premise of CA is that the topic of social interaction per se has been virtually ignored by mainstream social science disciplines and that through the detailed inspection of transcriptions of recordings of conduct in naturally occurring social settings we are able to appreciate the complex forms of order and organization which constitute this bedrock of spoken interaction—the substrate upon which all the institutions of society inescapably depend. The primary aim of CA is to document this order and the systematic methods or practices which human actors rely upon to carry out their everyday social lives. As with its progenitor, ethnomethodology, it is difficult to apply standard scientific categories—theory, method, research design, etc.—to CA. Rather than pursue the testing of hypotheses derived from a priori theorizing, CA favors a more inductive approach to theory building based on the close inspection of actual sequences of conduct. By the same token, although CA does have methodological principles and procedures it is not something that can be utilized in a decontextualized fashion as, for example, an alternative to traditional thematic techniques for analyzing the content of verbal data such as recorded interviews. Since its emergence in the mid-1960s, there have been a number of developments in its core foci. Although the organization of ordinary or mundane conversational interaction still continues to receive scholarly attention, a significant amount of research activity is now undertaken into the talk which transpires in institutional or work-related settings. In addition, many commentators now identify two strands within CA. The first, which has become consolidated as the principal mode of CA research, is concerned with the structural organization of talk and the actions which particular sequences of turns accomplish. The second strand deals with the way descriptions of the social world are made in talk and the categories and commonsense knowledge which are constitutive parts of this process (see Membership Categorization Analysis). Although prominent in the early CA writings, this strand is now less conspicuous. CA is now firmly established within the social sciences. Although its roots are in sociology, the CA approach now informs a great deal of the research work in cognate fields such as linguistics, communication, anthropology, social psychology, education and child development, human-computer interaction, counseling, and psychotherapy.</p>",sociology

While much of this research focuses on the experiences of marginalized people (gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and other identities), critical attention has also been paid to the social construction of heterosexual or straight identities. Theoretical perspectives from fields like queer theory and psychology have informed this thinking, and activism and research specifically from queer theory has significantly influenced how researchers understand sexual identities. Intersections with other identities are also critical to understanding sexual identities, and much forward-thinking work on sexual identities examines gender, race, class, and ability simultaneously. This bibliography outlines research on sexual identity, beginning with key sources like Journals, Edited Volumes, and Online and Popular Sources. The Theoretical Foundations section includes classic works, best for those seeking an introduction to the field. The Studying Identity: Research Methods section addresses how sexual identities might be best studied, as well as ongoing methodological challenges. Also included are sections discussing how sexual identities have been defined, including histories of sexual identities, intersections with other identities and changing identity categories, research on sexual identity and the self, research that examines the relationship between sexual identity and behavior, and works discussing how sexual identities are understood in relationships and religion. Sections addressing collective sexual identities and identities in spaces examine how identities are used in social movements and how sexual identities shape and are shaped by communities. Finally, a section focused on the political economy of sexual identities addresses the relationships between sexualities, nations, economies, and policy.

A vast majority of scholarship dealing with gender inequality focuses on women and the ways that they are structurally and systematically subordinated to men and disadvantaged. Scholars of inequality note, however, that there are two sides to inequality: disadvantage and privilege. Masculinities scholars study the various ways that men are—as a group—privileged, as well as focusing on the costs of those privileges and the ways in which not all men are granted equal access to them. “Masculinity” refers to the behaviors, social roles, and relations of men within a given society as well as the meanings attributed to them. The term masculinity stresses gender, unlike male, which stresses biological sex. Thus studies of masculinities need not be confined to biological males. Masculinity studies is a feminist-inspired, interdisciplinary field that emerged in the last few decades of the 20th century as a topic of study. It deals with the diversity of identities, behaviors, and meanings that occupy the label masculine and does not assume that they are universal. Thus scholars of masculinity often refer to masculinities in the plural to highlight the diversity of meanings, roles, and behaviors consumed in the term. Despite the fact that gender is often experienced as intensely personal—an internal facet of our identity—masculinities are produced and reproduced through the course of our daily interactions as well as within the larger institutions of society. This bibliography provides resources and an introductory overview of historical studies of masculinity, theories of masculinity and gender inequality, the relationship between masculinity and sexuality, the literature dealing with diverse men’s movements, and a summary of findings within various social institutions (education, the family, the workplace, sport, and the media).</p>",sociology

Sociologists up until the last quarter of the 20th century assumed that religion was in the process of a slow death—a process called “secularization.” Sociologists now see secularization as occurring only in certain parts of social life, opening the door to the study of the religious influences on a range of social behaviors such as immigration, race relations, and politics. For example, some scholars have asked why immigrants are more religious than others. Other sociologists continue to study religion itself in congregations, or as systems of belief. For example, some sociologists have asked why American religion is increasingly individualistic. American sociologists of religion have remained focused on religion in America and have made limited forays into other parts of the world.

The social relations of work, whether directly or through their economic impact, shape every aspect of our existence. To discuss labor globally might come close to requiring a discussion of everything. Understandings of capitalism as a global system, and perceptions of labor’s orientation as necessarily internationalist, also go back at least to Marx and Engel’s Communist Manifesto and the First International. This article limits its ambition by concentrating on important claims of transformation (roughly) since the 1970s. After introducing some general overviews in the next section, the article is organized (somewhat arbitrarily) into three related themes. The first theme involves claims of globalization as a spatial reorganization, with sections introducing literature on globalization as responsible for a labor’s disempowerment, especially in the (Global) North, works on global value chains, and works on labor in the (Global) South. The second theme involves claims of the emergence of a “new economy” as a social transformation of labor markets, work and workplaces, and changing prospects for labor’s agency and strategy. Here the sections consider “big-picture” claims of the division of labor and economic transformation, more qualified depictions noting continuities and possibilities for labor resistance, and more-specific literatures on the proliferation of precarious labor and the connections between free and unfree labor. Finally, the third theme considers the implications for labor organizing. Typically, attention focuses either on the need for labor internationalism or on new strategies more appropriate to the new economy. The emphasis on depictions of restructuring in the last few decades and rethinking labor’s situation means that not only the long history but also several modern issues are dealt with only in passing. Perhaps most conspicuously, more could be said of labor migration, which is covered in an existing article; see the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Sociology article “Immigration.” Similarly, although several listed texts emphasize the gendered nature of change and the connections between paid and unpaid labor, readers should also see the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Sociology article “Women’s Employment and Economic Inequality between Households.” This article also largely avoids referring to country-specific studies, although many of the most influential early texts based their analyses of change on the United States.</p>",sociology

Sexuality is undeniably shaped by gender as an individual, interpersonal, and institutional force. It is also shaped by intersecting axes of difference including class, race, ethnicity, age, and body morphology or disability status. These are in turn also affected by sexuality. The study of gendered sexuality has been an interdisciplinary undertaking. The sociological field incorporates insights from anthropology, feminist philosophy, gender and women’s studies, history, LGBTQIA+ studies, cultural studies, media studies, psychology, and queer studies. Early sociology failed to recognize sexuality as a domain of social study, so the subject only gained relevance in sociology in the second half of the 20th century. Touchstone texts from the subfield’s formation often draw on non-sociological works as well as biological, medical, and psychoanalytic approaches. Newer advances in the study of sexuality were initially spurred by feminisms and activist-scholars from the lesbian, bisexual, and gay liberation movement. As such, alongside theoretical development and empirical study, some work in the discipline retains a normative approach, seeking to clarify and advance varying definitions of sexual liberation. Contemporary sociological research on sexuality focuses on resultant inequalities: whether between genders (mostly still conceived of as either men and women) between sexual orientations (mostly still understood as either straight or gay) or between different races or ethnicities. As such, sociological study on sexualities focuses on the collective consequences of sexuality as a varied and changing institutional and normative force.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0199,"<p>Ever since the emergence of sociology as a discipline, sociologists have shown an interest in paid work. Marx, Weber, and Durkheim’s interest in societal changes was inspired by the rise of market relations and paid work. The classical sociologists studied the growth and spread of paid work in relation to the development of inequality, rationalization, and social cohesion. Since then, the form and content of employment relationships has changed substantially and keeps on changing. The continued interest of sociologists in these developments has culminated in a well-established field of research. This article explores that field of research in three parts. The first part of the bibliography lists textbooks, reference manuals, journals, and national research traditions. The field shows substantial variety due to the constant development of the labor market and employment relations, and due to institutional differences in the architecture of employment relations. The second part of the article focuses on developments in paid work. The following themes are explored: the growth of paid work relationships, the increase in the number of paid work hours, the major changes in the architecture of employment relationships, the effects of paid work relationships on the well-being of workers, and the development of work values and work-hour preferences. The third part focuses on different labor market positions. This section starts with the standard employment relationship and then moves on to its counterpart: unemployment. It continues with workers in nonstandard positions, such as temporary jobs, part-time jobs, jobs with irregular and long work hours, and self-employed workers.</p>",sociology

Transnational adoption changed ideas around family and kinship as children were not only being adopted cross-nationally but also cross-racially. Because transnational adoption quickly began to transgress the race-matching procedures that guided initial intercountry and domestic adoptions, this new form of family making drew both public attention and research interests. This article primarily focuses on transnational adoption to the United States and the controversies, politics, and outcomes surrounding it. Initial research studies in the 1960s and 1970s in social work and psychology began with a focus largely on children’s psychological and social adjustment into their adoptive families before continuing across disciplines such as law; gender and family studies; cultural studies; and sociology. As research continued, attention reflected disciplinary foci expanding from outcome studies to examinations of the effect of policies, politics (domestic and geopolitical), and race, class, and gender. Given the growth of transnational adoption globally, in 1995 the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption entered into force with the goal of securing the “best interests of the child” and preventing child trafficking and other abuses. In recent decades, new sending countries have open and closed relatively quickly, though China remains a major sending country to the United States for the past two decades, while longer-standing sending countries such as Korea have changed their policies, resulting in decreased adoptions to the United States. These changes, along with a growing awareness of the inequalities inherent in transnational adoption and increased consideration for first families, raise new research questions around the future of adoption.</p>",sociology

Since race is socially constructed, dominant groups in society have shaped and informed racial categories in order to maintain systems of power—thereby also producing racial inequality. Racial categorization has primarily been simplistic, essentialist, and typological in nature, forcing people to “fit” into categories that do not necessarily reflect their ethnic or national heritage. The process of racialization has shifted racial boundaries, depending on sociopolitical pressures for inclusion into particular racial groups or even the systematic exclusion of people due to social forces such as war or labor market pressures. Racism is a byproduct of racial categorization that focuses on the hierarchical arrangement of various racial groups. Racism is an oppressive force that creates and reproduces a complex system social inequality. Sociologists strive to illuminate the dynamics behind the persistent and lingering inequalities and injustices that continue to persist in our racialized society.</p>",sociology

It draws upon the concept of the captive mind, developed by Syed Hussein Alatas, a Southeast Asian intellectual, to critically explore the indigenisation of sociology in Nigeria. In doing so, the article explores the development and entrenchment of Eurocentric sociology as well as attempts at indigenising it over five decades of the production of sociological knowledge in Nigerian universities.

Most people have agreed, moreover, that a society is defined by a correspondence between institutions, values and forms of authority, on one side, and internalized norms and agencies of socialization and maintenance of normal behavior, on the other. Very few people today use these words or this general frame of reference, because societies, to a large extent, have disappeared, fallen into pieces or faded away. We are in a constantly changing world and there is no general, integrated process of change. We live in social settings in which the autonomization of various components of social life is so complete that it is useless to consider them as subsystems. Many sociologists are satisfied with notions like mass culture, individualization, fragmentation or dissocialization processes, or are fascinated by a spreading violence, internal or international wars and our capacity for self-destruction, etc. But this approach is too limited, because it is entirely negative. Thus, a high priority for sociologists is to propose one or various images of social actors collective or individual. But is it possible to propose an analysis of actors completely separate from a theory of social systems? This article proposes a positive answer to this difficult question.",sociology

Burawoy provides a novel justification for advocacy scholarship in sociology. Public sociology is intended to have political effects, but also to be funded by the politically neutral state. He argues that public sociology is institutionally neutral, but that committing to an organic relation with a social movement is legitimate as a matter of the sociologist's personal value choice.

To make the case for the method, the article follows a historical example: the use of indigenous hydraulics with Roman provenance on the Canal du Midi in 17th-century France. Women labourers brought hydraulics techniques derived from Roman principles to the canal, but their work was not considered classical.

In some countries, more than one in five residents were not born in the country where they live, while the economies of other countries are heavily dependent on the money that migrants send back. Migration thus affects a wide range of societies around the globe and can affect almost all aspects of human life. Sociologists consequently seek to explain population movements and state policies of migration control, debate theories of integration across a range of human activities, and consider the consequences of migration for development, national identities, and conceptions of membership in a world increasingly characterized by human relationships that span the borders of contemporary nation-states. Sociologists who work on migration do so in conversation with scholars drawn from many disciplines, including anthropology, demography, economics, ethnic studies, geography, history, legal studies, and political science. Given that the sociological field of migration studies is fundamentally interdisciplinary, any bibliography must be multidisciplinary, and it will invariably provide only a very small snapshot of the whole.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0084,"<p>“Social closure” is one of the most basic terms and concepts in sociology. Basically, closure refers to processes of drawing boundaries, constructing identities, and building communities in order to monopolize scarce resources for one’s own group, thereby excluding others from using them. Society is not a homogenous entity but is instead internally structured and subdivided by processes of social closure. Some social formations, such as groups, organizations, or institutions, may be open to everybody, provided they are capable of participation, while access to most others is limited due to certain criteria that either allow people to become members or exclude them from membership. Therefore, social closure is a ubiquitous, everyday phenomenon that can be observed in almost every sphere and place in the social world. Members of societies experience closure from the very beginning of their social life. To be excluded from certain groups starts at school, where presumably homogenous classes begin to subdivide into distinct peer groups or sports teams. Here, exclusion may be rather arbitrary, but the experience of having a door slammed in one’s face proceeds in cases, where inclusion depends on formal rules or preconditions. Access to private schools follows explicit rules and depends on financial capacities; access to university depends on a certificate or diploma, eventually from certain schools only; membership in a highly prestigious club depends on economic and social capital and the respective social networks; and finally, in the case of migration, people will have to be eligible for citizenship and pass the thorny path of naturalization. However, it is not just the enormous plurality of forms that makes social closure crucial for sociology. Rather, the process of closure of social relations—of groups, organizations, institutions, and even national societies—is the fundamental process of both “communal” (Vergemeinschaftung) and “associative” relationships (Vergesellschaftung), and neither would be possible without social closure. In this broad and fundamental sense, social closure is not restricted to processes in national societies. It even allows for understanding crucial processes of the way the social world is organized at the regional or global level.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0229,"<p>Theoretically, the term “doing gender” first appeared in Harold Garfinkel’s case study of the intersexual Agnes in 1967, as an appendix to Garfinkel 1967 (cited under General Overview). The term was then discussed in Kessler and McKenna 1978 (cited under General Overview). The authors drew from Erving Goffman’s social constructionist theory of performance in establishing, first, the difference between sex and gender, and second, how gender was something people actively constructed in their daily lives. The provocation was therefore that if people were responsible for “doing” gender then they could also be held accountable for “undoing” gender. The book, however, was obscured by the proliferation of research regarding sex roles, rather than gender constructions. So, the concept of “doing gender” remained underground for a while, until it resurfaced in 1987 in the well-known paper of the same name written by American sociologists Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman (West and Zimmerman 1987, cited under General Overview). According to these authors, “doing” gender is defined as involving the everyday performance of “a complex of socially guided perceptual, interactional, and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of masculine and feminine ‘natures.’ When we view gender as an accomplishment, an achieved property of situated conduct, our attention shifts from matters internal to the individual and focuses on interactional and, ultimately, institutional arenas” (p. 126). West and Zimmerman were primarily focused on understanding how people created gender differences, rather than merely “gender.” Unlike Kessler and McKenna, who discussed the applicability of doing gender in transsexualism, West and Zimmerman finely combed the differences between “sex,” “sex category,” and “gender.” Following on from this, Deutsch 2007 together with Connell 2010 (both cited under Critiques of Doing Gender) critiqued this concept and proposed the “redoing of gender.” For example, Connell’s research uncovered that for transpeople, doing gender entailed “experiences that fit better under either the rubric of undoing gender or of redoing gender,” that transpeople “often attempted to meld together masculine and feminine gender performances” (p. 39), and that “many resisted these pressures by adapting a hybrid gender style of interacting with others. These acts constitute moments of ‘chipping away’ at the established gender order” (pp. 42–43). In addition, Judith Butler (see Butler 2004, cited under Critiques of Doing Gender) was more interested in exploring how gender could be undone, and defines this undoing as escaping “gender as a kind of a doing, an incessant activity performed . . . an improvisation within a scene of constraint” (p. 3) by underlining the “paradox of autonomy, a paradox that is heightened when gender regulations work to paralyze gendered agency at various levels” (p. 101). From this perspective, there are limits to how much agency individuals can have in performing gender. As such and inadvertently, social actors also undo gender when they relate to each other: “Despite one’s best efforts, one is undone, in the face of the other, by the touch, by the scent, by the feel, by the prospect of the touch, by the memory of the feel. And so, when we speak about my sexuality or my gender, as we do (and as we must) we mean something complicated by it” (p. 19). Butler’s focus on embodiment definitively pushed the debate further by critically assessing the usefulness of considering gender as an activity and asking sociologists to consider the ontological implication of the performativity of gender in relation to its mere performance. Her work is important because it clearly underlined the neglect of feminist studies to focus more on transgender identities, thereby sparking the growth of a specific area of knowledge known today as “queer theory.” In response to these developments, “doing gender” was further developed by West and Zimmerman 2009 (cited under General Overview), a celebratory symposium published twenty-two years after West and Zimmerman 1987 to assess the more recent applicability of this term in the field of gender studies. Methodologically, searching for resources on the theme of “doing gender” has focused on the performance of gender and on the domains of research to which it has been applied so far, as indicated by the specific headings in this article, while considering as well the “undoing of gender” and its performativity. Not all experts in the field would agree with this organization. However, it is important to specify the many ways in which the influential concept has branched out and deeply affected the field of gender studies. Therefore, the reader will notice a running consideration in the papers selected for this entry, with both the doing and the undoing of gender across a variety of areas: in education and at work, across cultures and intersectionally, in relation to emotions and in personal life (where a distinction was made again between parenting and romantic coupling and partnership), for youth health, and beyond the binary. This way of organizing the material falls in line with the most recent developments in the field. A simple search on the Web of Science database of the words “doing gender” within the publications category and in the topics of “Sociology” and “Women’s studies” between 1987 (when West and Zimmerman first published their paper) and 2019 reveals a total of 866 resources. Therefore, as not all resources could be included, the ones that appear in this entry were selected based on relevance, recency of publication, number of citations, prominence in the field, and methodological innovation (such as doing gender in visual sociology, or anthologies that focus on diverse cultural examples). The scope was meant to be relevant, versatile, approachable, and useful to teachers, researchers, and interested students. Nonetheless, there is the limitation that only English-language resources are included. The General Overview section is focused on the development of the term “doing gender” in theory and research, including the original paper discussed in this section and others published in a symposium, while the section on Critiques of Doing Gender presents a series on ongoing critiques to the concept of “doing gender.”</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0267,"<p>While cities have existed for millennia, it wasn’t until the advent of industrialization in the late eighteenth century that the world entered a process of mass urbanization. Sociology has been preoccupied with understanding the nature of urban life since then. Yet since the turn of the twenty-first century, sociologists, geographers, and urban studies scholars have begun noting that the voluminous literature on cities and urban life produced over a century of research and theorizing is almost exclusively based on the metropolitan experience of big cities in the Global North. Emerging literature on small cities has identified several trends that have rendered them nearly invisible to urban sociology. In their search for generalizable knowledge, sociologists have prioritized big cities as the best indicators of urbanity, creating seemingly universal categories of urban analysis that often hide, instead of illuminate, the urban dynamics of small cities. This focus has also created a false sense that most urban dwellers live in the metropolis. In the United States, the majority of the urban population lives in cities with less than 250,000 inhabitants, making them the modal form of urban life, while big cities like NYC, LA, and Chicago are the exception. That said, while drawing attention to small cities as a distinct category of urban research, sociologists have nonetheless struggled to define what constitutes a “small city.” One difficulty stems from sizeism, or the inability to draw clear boundaries based on population size. While “incorporated areas with less than 100,000 residents” is often used as a shorthand, urban characteristics do not suddenly change once such an arbitrary population number is surpassed. Another difficulty is the relativeness of “small” in global context: a Chinese city of 700,000 could be considered small in that context, but not elsewhere. Despite these definitional challenges, this scholarship maintains that renewed attention to small cities should bring tangible benefits to urban sociology at large. Small cities do not represent a lack of, deviant, or antagonistic forms of urbanity; they constitute an important node within the diverse modes of urbanity. Their urban problems may be recognizable to big cities, but often operate through a different set of variables within the small city context. This encyclopedia entry summarizes this corrective turn to the big city bias, outlines existing research on small(er) cities, and underscores growing calls for giving small cities their due attention.</p>",sociology

The problematic of the slumghetto sharpened in focus and there was increasing recourse to American research and policy initiatives in regenerating the cities.

A deeper understanding of the social causes and consequences of climate change is evolving in sociology, yet some of the discipline’s subfields have not responded to climate change. Is this because climate change is perceived to be irrelevant or are scholars suppressing new beliefs that could disrupt the norms of their field? The sociology of the arts provides an illustrative case. This subfield has historically ignored environmental factors, but there is mounting pressure for correcting this oversight and rethinking the beliefs and norms of the field. This article argues that climate change is relevant to the sociology of the arts and that this subfield can become more aligned with the geo-ecological turn in sociology and the SSH. This turn is part of a wider epochal and existential transformation in public consciousness in response to broad changes in society and nature. Changing beliefs about the arts are therefore not explained by endogenous dynamics in the arts field. The article provides a meta-analysis of the geo-ecological turn in sociology and in interdisciplinary arts and cultural research where pioneering arguments have emerged. The analysis uses theory of disciplinary transformation in the sociology of science to analyze largely implicit sociological claims for a transformation of ‘normal science’ beliefs about (1) aesthetic exceptionalism, illustrated by a new conception of music as a study object, and (2) the role of the arts in economic growth.

Positive, in Comte’s sense, meant abandoning absolute for relative truth, and the search for the real nature or cause of things, in favor of discovering laws, defined as predictable regularities in the behavior of observable phenomena. Comte’s sociology, divided into statics (laws of social order) and dynamics (laws of historical progress), was integral to his wider positivist system. Its founding completed the “encyclopedic scale” of the fundamental sciences (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, sociology) and made finally possible, he claimed, both a scientific politics and an all-embracing positive philosophy that was destined—following the “law of three states”—to supersede previous worldviews based on theology and metaphysics, together with their corresponding societal forms. Positive philosophy, complemented after the mid-1840s by positive religion, was the cornerstone of Comte’s program for social reform in post–Revolutionary France, and for the global establishment of an industrial-scientific order. Comte’s politics, like his philosophy, aimed to transcend the split between Enlightenment progressives and Counter-Enlightenment traditionalists. In addition to Bacon, Leibnitz, and Hume, he cited both Condorcet and de Maistre as major influences. Although the social sciences have long since abandoned Comte’s search for historical laws together with his wider system and project, the Durkheim tradition bears some of Comte’s imprint as do related currents in French thought like historical epistemology (Bachelard, Canguilhem) and structural Marxism (Althusser). Interest in Comte (influential in the 19th century but long considered a marginal figure) has revived in recent years among philosophers, social theorists, and students of religion, and his voluminous oeuvre has begun to be more sympathetically reassessed. The rebellious elder son of a conservative provincial tax official and a devoutly Catholic mother, Isidore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier Comte was born in Montpellier in the penultimate year of the Directory before Napoleon came to power. By his mid-teens he was a staunch atheist and republican. After winning admission in 1814 to the elite École Polytechnique in Paris to study mathematics and the physical sciences, he was expelled in 1816 together with his classmates after a conflict with school authorities. Following a year studying biology in the faculty of medicine at Montpellier, he returned to Paris, refused the loyalty oath to the restored monarchy that would have readmitted him to the École, and joined the Saint-Simonian circle. He became Saint-Simon’s secretary and principal collaborator until they acrimoniously split in 1824. Between 1826 and 1840 (interrupted by a mental breakdown in 1826–1827) Comte presented a celebrated lecture series, sixty in all, with a number of eminent scientists in attendance. Published in six volumes—the last three devoted to sociology—the Cours de philosophie positive established Comte as a major intellectual figure, winning the support of John Stuart Mill in England and Émile Littré in France. However, his subsequent Systême de politique positive (1851–1854)—with its religious frame, neo-medieval social program and prayerful dedication to Clotilde de Vaux (their tragically short-lived Platonic affair in 1844–1845 had catalyzed his religious turn)—divided his followers and dimmed his reputation. In his final years he continued his writings, including the never completed Synthèse subjective, lobbied rulers including the Czar and Ottoman Sultan for reform from above, and organized his church. Recurrently in ill-health, he died in Paris in 1857.</p>",sociology

In contrast, the sociology of social problems defines social problem differently and adopts a different analytic approach. This approach—sometimes called constructionist—defines social problem in terms of a process, rather than a type of condition. It focuses on how and why people come to understand that some conditions ought to be viewed as a social problem, that is, how they socially construct social problems. Typically, the social problems process begins with claimsmakers who make claims that some condition ought to be considered a problem, that this problem should be understood in particular ways, and that it needs to be addressed. Other people respond to those claims and rework them, so that the social problem is constructed and reconstructed by the media, the general public, policymakers, the social-problems workers who implement policy, and critics that assess the policy’s effectiveness. The process is complex: some claims produce a speedy reaction, while others have difficulty finding an audience. The constructionist approach began to guide researchers in the 1970s and has generated a substantial literature that continues to develop in new directions.</p>",sociology

More recent work has critiqued the idea of two distinct genders, calling into question the notion of gender dichotomies and focusing attention on gender as a constitutive element of all social relationships. Gender has been described as a social institution that structures the organization of other institutions, such as the labor market, families, and the state, as well as the social relations of everyday life. In addition, scholars have pointed to the ways in which gender is constructed by organizations and individual interactions. Gender not only differentiates men and women into unequal groups, it also structures unequal access to goods and resources, often crosscutting and intersecting with other forms of inequality, such as class, race, and ethnicity.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0030,"<p>Sociology of the life course is a sophisticated theoretical paradigm designed to understand human lives. Four key assumptions guide life course scholars’ theoretical and empirical work: (1) lives are embedded in and shaped by historical context; (2) individuals construct their own lives through their choices and actions, yet within the constraints of historical and social circumstance; (3) lives are intertwined through social relationships; and (4) the meaning and impact of a life transition is contingent on when it occurs. Life course scholars also rely on rigorous research methods and data sources—including national censuses, sample surveys, in-depth interviews, and historical records—to document human lives. Because a key question of life course research is “how does historical time and place shape lives?” researchers often compare data obtained at different points in time, from different birth cohorts (i.e., individuals born at different points in history), and from different national and cultural contexts. Researchers also rely heavily on longitudinal data, or data obtained from the same person at multiple points in time, so they can track individual-level continuity and change. Life course research is interdisciplinary, incorporating concepts from sociology, history, psychology, demography, gerontology, child development, and—in recent years—behavioral genetics. The specific foci of life course studies range from social psychological outcomes such as stress, self-esteem, occupational values, and cognitive complexity to family roles, marital and fertility patterns, educational and occupational attainment, retirement, and deviance. Although many life course scholars typically specialize in one developmental stage, such as childhood, adolescence, midlife, or older adulthood, most also consider ways that one life course stage influences subsequent experiences. Most life course research has focused on the U.S. context, yet in recent years the collection of longitudinal data—especially in the United Kingdom and western Europe—has fostered a flourishing of life course research in Europe.</p>",sociology

Given the interdisciplinary nature of media/communication analysis, establishing what falls within media sociology and drawing clear-cut distinctions between sociological and other approaches are not easy tasks. Here, media sociology is understood as research that situates communication and media research within the dynamics of social forces and links them to questions about order, conflict, identity, institutions, stratification, authority, community, and power. The origins of mass communication/media research are grounded in sociology. Not only was it sociologists who charted key themes in the field of communication/media studies, particularly in the United States in the 1920s, but foundational research was concerned with core sociological questions, such as the integrative role of the media in the transition from traditional to modern societies and the community-building dimensions of the media. Around the time of World War II, US media sociology experienced two transitions. Geographically, the center of studies moved from the University of Chicago to Columbia and Harvard Universities, and the research foci changed from news and media to public opinion and mass communication. Analytically, the focus shifted from the relation between media and modern society to questions about war propaganda and persuasion. Given the focus on the dynamics of public opinion, sociological questions about personal and media influence moved to the forefront, and interest in issues related to media and community faded. With financial support from the US government and private foundations, public opinion attracted considerable attention from media and communication researchers in the 1950s. However, as questions embedded in social psychology and behavioral research gained currency, sociological approaches, particularly those focused on structural issues, gradually lost centrality. This shift indicated the beginning of the rift between sociology and media/communication studies in the United States. Sociological theories and questions increasingly became less relevant for mass communication research. The historical trajectory of media sociology has been different in Europe, however. It has not had the focus on public opinion research and media effects that it has in the United States. Instead, it has been grounded in different theoretical paradigms and research questions. Traditionally, it has been more concerned with questions about class, power, institutions, and social differentiation.</p>",sociology

These points of contact between early sociological and neoliberalism are addressed in detail in order to consider the challenges that the latter poses to sociological thought. It is argued that because the neoliberal project developed out of an epistemological and political critique of classical ideas of the ‘social’, this places sociology in a position of strength to advance a critical response to the intellectual basis of neoliberalism.",sociology

Campbell concludes that our discipline has made little progress in the past half-century. This essay describes what Campbell means by progress, and the factors that, on his account, impede it. The discussion focuses on one such obstacle: the politicization of the university. The older current of ideological advocacy, that Campbell highlights, is today bolstered by a newer development: ideological policing. This is a posture that attacks free expression and viewpoint diversity. The fate of sociology hinges on colleagues grasping the dangers of such policing and finding ways to check it.

10.1111/soc4.12735,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>According to many, sociology is facing a crisis of relevance. Of particular concern is sociology's inability to impact policy. Sociologists, who should be the go‐to on major policy issues have been sidelined as other social scientists take up roles as policy advisors. Recent efforts aimed at encouraging public engagement have focused on disseminating research and producing more policy‐relevant knowledge. These are welcome resources, but they reflect a deep ambivalence toward policy sociology and a tendency to conflate participation in public discussions with policy impact. In contrast, this essay draws on recent findings about the power of policy experts to develop an organic policy sociology. Organic policy sociology depends on co‐designing and carrying out research with policymakers with whom we share critical and professional commitments. By working collaboratively with policymakers, sociologists can foster equity‐promoting policy, change how policymakers understand social problems, and improve how citizens experience policy on the ground. To that end, I offer six orienting strategies for developing and maintaining organic policy sociology projects, from finding the right partner to assessing the impact of our work.",sociology
10.1177/0011392198046002008,"Sociology was born not when good and evil were defined by what is useful or harmful to society, but rather when this correlation, exalted by the utilitarians, was placed in doubt because individualism seemed to have become a menace to society. This disjunction of the actor and the system led the most radical thinkers to conceive of a system without actors, dominated by determinisms and impersonal powers, and others to describe actors without a system, constructing in a normative void the forms of their interaction with actors who were strangers. Homo sociologicus, exalted by political philosophy, has disappeared. The globalization of the economy, which has entailed a weakening of the social and political controls that existed at the national level, has led in return to the development of identity politics which no longer defend a function but a being, not a project but a memory, which contradicts the evolution that has long defined modernity. We cannot establish a link between the system and the actor unless the latter is defined by the construction of his or her own liberty and not by the playing of specific social roles, and the former as a civil society in which the collective conditions of individual freedom are created. Social solidarity is the condition of cultural diversity, that is to say, the possibility for each person to combine in his or her own way their identity with participation in the techno-economic world.",sociology

Therefore Japan and Japanese sociology tend to understand Japan as unique and deviating from the West. The second point this article deals with is that Japanese sociologists are doing ‘homolingual address’ rather than ‘heterolingual address’. The article shows that reflexive endless translation is necessary for all of us, not only for Japanese sociologists but also sociologists all over the world. In this context, the article stresses the importance of Gerard Delanty’s analysis of the relationship between cultural translation and modernity.

10.1177/003803850203600402,"This paper clarifies and develops some of the arguments put forward by W.G. Runciman in his 1998 Sociology article ‘The Selectionist Paradigm and Its Implications for Sociology’. It intends to support his basic claim that mechanisms analogous to (but not synonymous with) natural selection are an important way of understanding both continuity and change in social systems. Nonetheless, it questions the emphasis of his discussion and extends his analysis of two substantive points. The argument proceeds in two stages. The paper begins by examining the many objections that Runciman rebuts and showing that many of them do not need rebuttal but are simply irrelevant to the selectionist paradigm. By irrelevant, I mean that the objections are logically flawed or simply do not apply to the selectionist paradigm as Runciman defines it. The purpose of this part of the paper is to sharpen the debate, so that attention can subsequently be focused on a smaller number of relevant objections that remain. The remainder of the paper attempts to open that debate by discussing the two relevant objections that appear most forceful. It attempts to show that, on closer examination, both objections are mistaken. The first objection is that human deliberation makes any analogy with random mutation in biology untenable. The paper argues that in fact selection and deliberation are complementary. Selection will continue to act on social practices to the extent that our models of the world are imperfect and our practices have unintended consequences. The second objection is that while selectionism is interesting, it may be irrelevant to sociological practice. The last part of the paper provides a more detailed analysis of an example used by Runciman, the task of explaining differing levels of male lethal violence across societies. This analysis suggests that while Runciman’s ‘discursive’ selectionist analysis (like functionalism) can generate suggestive hypotheses, appropriate techniques will be needed to transform those hypotheses into models which sociological research can ultimately test. It is argued that multi-agent computer simulation is a particularly suitable technique for representing evolutionary processes in social systems thus allowing selectionism to be put on the same sort of footing as other ‘middle range’ explanations like game theory and social network analysis.",sociology

Or will sociology, as Morris puts it, “continue pretending to be an aloof, objective, detached science”? Recently, Hirschman and Garbes issued a call for an economic sociology of race, wherein they contend that race and racism are not central to economic sociology and that economic sociologists don't engage with contemporary race scholarship. In this paper, I assess and build upon their call. I argue that while the article importantly calls for understanding race and racism in economic sociology, in practice, it—used here as an example of a broader pattern within economic sociology—re‐centers whiteness and men, reifies elitism, and erases marginalized scholars and their contributions. I set forth an alternative perspective. To rise to the Du Boisian challenge, scholars need to critique racialized modernity as Itzigsohn and Brown importantly argue. We must also root our sociological consciousness, citation practices, and conversations in existing, yet marginalized, research. Failure to do so means future research risks reproducing inequities in the discipline and continuing to marginalize the very people, theories, and research that an emancipatory sociology is meant to address.",sociology

These forms of self-criticism become ever more acute in terms of their potential effects as huge transformations in university funding regimes are brought to bear on the social sciences. But none of these critiques engages satisfactorily with what is a much more foundational and serious set of problems, namely the very nature of sociology itself as a historically-situated form of knowledge production. Sociology claims to know the world around it, but in Britain today much sociology seriously fails in this regard, because it operates with radically curtailed understandings of the long-term historical forces which made the social conditions it purports to analyse. A sophisticated understanding of the contemporary world is made possible only by an equally sophisticated understanding of very long-term historical processes, precisely the sort of vision that mainstream British sociology has lacked for at least the last two decades. This paper identifies the reasons for the development of this situation and the consequences it has for the nature of sociology’s knowledge production, for its self-understanding, for its claims to comprehend the contemporary world, and for its apparent social ‘usefulness’. A markedly more self-aware and historically-sensitive sociology is proposed as the answer to the pressing question of what aspects of sociology should be defended in the turbulent context of British higher education today.",sociology

Entrepreneurial opportunities are discovered in markets and organizations; how these opportunities are pursued results in different forms of entrepreneurship, such as independent start-ups, licensing activity, corporate ventures and spin-offs, and nonprofits. Entrepreneurship is therefore an engine of innovation and job creation that results in changing the distribution of wealth and fostering the well-being of individuals and groups in society. The field of entrepreneurship research is composed of interdisciplinary perspectives initially drawing from the social sciences. Because entrepreneurship is inexorably linked to institutional processes and organizational forms, the discipline of sociology has been and still remains central to the development of entrepreneurship research. In the early 21st century, considerable resources have been devoted to the study of entrepreneurship, and this momentum points to an increasing variety of research perspectives. Although this article takes a sociological view, it also includes selected works of authors in the sister social, management, and financial sciences that borrow sociological concepts or that more fully flesh out the relevance of the sociology of entrepreneurship.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0025,"<p>We outline four identity theories typically employed by contemporary social psychologists: personal identity, role identity, social identity, and collective identity. Personal identity (see [Personal] Identity Theory), the most elementary of the four identities, was pioneered by American sociological social psychologists (SSPs), particularly Sheldon Stryker. SSPs emphasize how demographic, social, and cultural factors affect human social interaction. Personal identity is what makes every person unique, defining them through their specific biographies (e.g., name, birthplace), unique characteristics (e.g., intelligent, athletic), role identities (e.g., daughter, employee), and particular combination of private and public experiences. Role identify (see Role Identity Theory), also pioneered by American SSPs, particularly George J. McCall and J. L. Simmons, is inspired by the language of dramaturgy. Role identity is defined as the role (or character) people play when holding specific social positions in groups. It is relational, since people interact with each other via their own role identities. Social identity (see Social Identity Theory), pioneered by European psychological social psychologists, particularly Henri Tajfel and John C. Turner, emphasizes how a person’s cognition, affect, and personality traits affect immediate person-to-person social interactions and vice versa. It is the part of an individual’s self-concept formed through the knowledge of his or her membership in meaningful social groups and organizations (e.g., Kiwanis Club, the Cleveland City Club) and categories (e.g., Native American, northerner). In short, it is through our public selves that we are able to simplify the world around us by using categorizations to infer our similarities and differences to other people. Finally, collective identity (see Collective Identity Theory), also pioneered by European psychological social psychologists, especially Alberto Melucci, is the self in action. Collective identities are especially important to social movement participants, political activists, and others banding together to fight for or against social change by working on shared goals and action plans. In short, it is a process by which a set of individuals interacts to create a shared sense of identity or group consciousness.</p>",sociology

This article outlines the main features of the debate and suggests various lines of analytical development which may help to resolve a number of remaining conceptual issues. Orientalism has been defined as a discourse which produces the orient as an object of power and knowledge. The discourse has a number of major themes: it provides an explanation of oriental stagnation, offering covertly a legitimation of western supremacy and colonial power; by categorizing oriental politics as despotic, because the orient excludes individualism, it offered a critique of mass democracy; and it contrasted the rationality of the occident with the sensual irrationalism of the orient. While the critique of orientalism in the 1970s was intellectually and morally important, there are some basic problems of epistemology in this tradition which are unresolved. The anti-foundationalist epistemology of the critique of orientalism often covertly relies upon a notion of the `real' orient, but it cannot offer an alternative discourse to conventional perspectives. The article argues that cultural globalism may challenge rather than support cognitive relativism because the idea of separate and different cultural traditions cannot be maintained.

Thus, while providing a view of Britain in 2025, this paper also asks questions about the imaginary that constitutes Britain and the ways in which it will be re-visioned as part of the `global cosmopolitan society'. This re-visioning is not, however, the preserve of sociology and the paper elaborates popular imaginaries on the future of Britain.

The alternative seems to be the retreat into a sociological relativism. The paper shows that it is possible to work out a science-theoretical paradigm which avoids the pitfalls of both philosophical absolutism and sociological relativism. It suggests that instead of discussing criteria of a fictitious absolute end-state of knowledge, one might try to discover criteria and conditions for the advance of knowledge, non-scientific and scientific. A theory of this kind has the added advantage that it can be tested by, and can serve as a guide for, empirical studies of sciences and of knowledge generally.

Initially, scholars saw nations as based on primordial attachments that were understood to exist as “given” through birth into a particular geographic community or ethnic group. This understanding has evolved into a view of “imagined communities” in which nations are based on a sense of attachment to one another among individuals dispersed across space and time and likely never to meet each other but who share customs, language, traditions, culture, or residence within a set of borders. Because these attachments are imagined by individuals and groups of individuals, neither nations nor the identities attached to them can be understood as essentialized, stable, or static. Instead, nations today are thought to be imagined, constructed, and negotiated. Nationalism exists in these moments of imagination and construction of the nation, which take many forms. The simple expression of national identity, efforts to make political and national units congruent, or xenophobic treatment of outsiders in favor of those deemed to belong to the nation are all examples of nationalist forms. Nationalism can be official and ceremonial (as in the singing of national anthems at presidential inaugurations) or banal (as in the quotidian nationalist symbols people encounter in their everyday lives, from national flags in school buildings to postage stamps displaying national heroes). Over the last several decades—particularly since a resurgence of interest in nationhood in the 1980s and 1990s—the focus of research has been on elite perspectives—that is, how the nation is mediated and constructed through parliamentary speeches, presidential speeches, or public school textbooks and curricula. More recently there has been a movement toward the study of everyday nationhood, which is discussed in greater detail in this article.</p>",sociology

The latter is frequently understood as sociology's special object with sociology itself a distinctively modern form of explanation. The period of sociology's disciplinary formation was also the heyday of European colonialism, yet the colonial relationship did not figure in the development of sociological understandings. While the recent emergence of postcolonialism appears to have initiated a reconsideration of understandings of modernity, with the development of theories of multiple modernities, I suggest that this engagement is more an attempt at recuperating the transformative aspect of postcolonialism than engaging with its critiques.

In the fourth section of the paper I present an alternative conception, or `view' of power which, I argue, sustains the essential features of Lukes's critique of the one- and two-dimensional views, but which, by severing the definitional tie between power and interests, avoids the value dependence of Lukes's own view of power. Finally, I make explicit a view of interests which runs counter to that which, I hold, Lukes, Connolly, et al. have in common with more orthodox political scientists.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0093,"<p>Despite copious studies on the middle classes, there is no single, widely held definition of the middle class. Some scholars define the middle class in terms of the relation to the means of production, others in terms of relative incomes, and still others in terms of consumption patterns. A common working definition might include those with incomes in the middle third of the income distribution; who work as upper- or lower-level managers, professionals, or small-business owners; who graduated from a four-year college or university; and whose primary source of wealth is home ownership. The sociological study of the middle classes has a long and varied past and has been driven by both theoretical and empirical concerns. Theoretically, much attention has been given to conceptualizing the historical middle classes in relation to other social classes and also accounting for the emergence of the new middle class in the latter part of the 20th century. Neo-Weberian and neo-Marxist theories of class represent two influential perspectives on the middle class. Both perspectives emphasize the importance of market capacities in shaping life chances and how the middle classes differ from the working class and the upper class on this dimension. Neo-Marxist arguments differ primarily in their additional focus on the relationship to the means of production as a key dimension of the class structure. A third influential approach to studying class structure focuses on the role of tastes, consumption patterns, and cultural boundaries in defining class relations and identifying the middle classes. Empirically, the literature on the middle class addresses the structural forces shaping the emergence of the middle class in different national contexts and how the political, economic, and social trends of the time shape the experiences of the middle class. Since the late 20th century there has been considerable attention given to analyzing the “new middle class” and uncovering in what ways members of this class differ from other classes in terms of political orientations and activities. Other work has focused on how the changing economic landscape of the postindustrial economy has led to economic uncertainty for many members of the middle class, causing an increase in consumer debt, bankruptcies, and downward mobility. The notion of social reproduction and middle-class advantage (vis-à-vis the working class) is a theme running throughout work examining the education system and studies examining religion.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0231,"<p>Across studies of racialized modernity, critical scholars since W. E. B. Du Bois have recognized that no analysis of racism is complete without studying the social dynamics surrounding whiteness. To be sure, studies of racism frequently center on racially subordinate groups——in terms of the discrimination they experience or, worse, as the source of racial inequalities and social problems. Scholars of whiteness, however, turn their attention to the myriad ways this fictional social construction works to reinforce white power, privilege, and wealth at the level of everyday, institutional, and global experience. Notably, though the term invokes ideas related to skin color, whiteness refers more specifically to a structural position—that is, to a racialized social identity that is positioned as superior relative to other “races” within a system of racial hierarchy. Indeed, because race is socially constructed—and not biological—whiteness can be understood as the result of social and cultural processes, rooted in a global history of European colonialism, imperialism, and transatlantic slavery, and maintained today through various institutions, ideologies, and everyday social practices. Whiteness embodies both a material reality—connected to the disproportionate economic and political power wielded by those racialized as white, as well as a symbolic reality—shaped by the cultural meanings attached to whiteness as a form of inflated value, morality, aesthetics, and civilization. White people thus derive both literal and psychological advantages from whiteness through societal norms, traditions, and institutions—conditions that mask and obscure the unjust nature of white domination. Indeed, the ideological component of white supremacy is profound: whiteness is regarded as the norm or standard in society, and yet the advantages that racial dominance accrues to white people are widely unacknowledged and ignored by white people. Du Bois perhaps cut closest to the core, describing whiteness as something that acquired an almost religious character in the modern world. As he wrote in his 1920 essay “The Souls of White Folk”: “I ask soberly: ‘But what on earth is whiteness that one should so desire it?’ Then always, somehow, some way, silently but clearly, I am given to understand that whiteness is ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen!”</p>",sociology

Since then, the phenomenon has gained widespread attention with advocacy and media campaigns, a flurry of new laws and celebrities taking on the cause of fighting modern-day slavery. The UN protocol defines trafficking as a set of actions (recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt) that if undertaken by one of a set of specified means (threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person) results in exploitation. The protocol notes that at a minimum, exploitation includes “the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.” If the victim is under eighteen, the means become irrelevant. Exploitation comes in many forms and in many industries—sex, factories, construction, fishing, domestic labor, to name a few—and involves men, women, and children alike. No country is unaffected. The subject of human trafficking is the province of many academic disciplines as it touches on a variety of areas of inquiry including migration, human rights, women’s rights, border security, prostitution, and labor rights. At the same time, it also has a strong history of being rooted in advocacy. In fact, much of the early research on human trafficking was carried out by advocacy organizations and journalists who brought much-needed attention to the issue. Scholars were relative latecomers to the game. However, over the past decade, scholarly research has exploded in volume and increased in quality as both qualitative and quantitative methods have been applied to better understand the phenomenon and its manifestations. The works contained here are a guide to the major issues in human trafficking and are intended to be accessible to students, academics, practitioners, and advocates.

The concept was coined by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu to explain educational inequality in France. His concept covers a wide variety of cultural resources, such as verbal facility, general cultural awareness, aesthetic preferences, information about the school system, and educational credentials. In later writings Bourdieu suggests that what he calls cultural capital should in fact be called “informational capital.” His point is to suggest that culture (in the broadest sense of the term) can become a power resource that socially differentiates insiders from outsiders. This inequality occurs when cultural resources become objects of struggle. The concept gained traction early in educational research, in which it has been used to explain differential achievement in schooling. As a measure of family background, the importance of cultural capital relative to income and other possible stratifying factors has become the object of considerable research and debate in the sociology of education. But the concept has been imported into many other substantive areas, such as culture, consumer tastes, family, organizations, and stratification to such an extent that today it is found across a broad range of the social sciences and now figures as an important concept in introductory sociology textbooks. And the concept has provoked criticism and debate relative to how it is measured, its effects, its distribution, and variations in different national contexts.</p>",sociology

Once a marginal area in the social sciences, social movement studies grew into a main field of study in sociology and a significant one in other proximate disciplines, such as political science, anthropology, geography, history, and psychology. This growth was accompanied by significant shifts in the ways in which social movements have been addressed. Before the 1970s, especially (but not only) in the United States, social movements were conceived of as forms of collective behavior, different from “normal” behavior because of high emotionality and, often, anomic syndromes; in Europe instead, especially the main historical social movement, the labor movement, was addressed within a Marxist perspective, with attention paid to the structural conditions for its development. Since the 1970s, both approaches were shaken by the spread of new forms of protest. First of all, in the United States, studies on the civil rights movement showed that it was neither irrational nor anomic, being instead guided by strategic behavior and strong normative systems. Social movement organizations started therefore to be seen as actors that mobilize resources in their environment for collective action. In Europe, the emergence of the student, the women’s, and the environmental movements were considered as examples of new social movements, bound to substitute for the increasingly institutionalized labor movement. Class-based approaches were therefore supplanted by an attention to emerging collective identities. Social movement studies in the 1970s and the following decade focused mainly on macro-level political opportunities for protest and organizational forms and strategies at the meso level, with only limited attention to social structures and individual commitment. Since the 1990s, this structural bias was then challenged by a renewed attention to various cultural aspects, as well as to the causal mechanisms that intervene between structure and action in a field redefined as contentious politics and covering social movements as well as revolutions, democratization, and other contentious phenomena.</p>",sociology

Taken together these influences led to a progressive process of displacement as first, the original `dynamic' connotations were discarded such that `motive' was equated with `the reason' or `the reasons' for acting, and then second, identified with `justifications' and `excuses'. The arguments advanced to support these changes of usage are then considered and shown to be in part dependent on selective interpretations, or to rest on contestable claims concerning the contexts in which actors might discuss motives and the role of actor-accounts in action.

Sex came to signify the biological or bodily component of difference, that is, male and female. Gender, on the other hand, came to signify the social or cultural component of difference, that is, masculine and feminine. This sex/gender distinction, as it is often called, was heartily embraced by many feminists of the day who sought to account for differences between the sexes as well as explain and remediate women’s second-class status in society. The establishment of gender as a distinctly “social” concept appealed to feminists because it opened up an intellectual and political space—a space beyond biological determinism—for inquiry into the causes of “male domination” and “female subordination” that were not essential, universal, or fixed. In this space, social change was possible; gender relations could be reconfigured. To that end, the sex/gender distinction became, by and large, paradigmatic in feminist thought and social science, and from it grew a burgeoning body of gender theory loosely characterized as the social construction of gender. Intersectional, post-structural, postmodern, and queer schools of thought produced new insights and advanced theory in ways that posed challenges to the viability and utility of gender as a concept as well as to the sex/gender paradigm. The ensuing debates were highly productive, ushering in a new era of social theory on the body that centered corporeality and embodiment and that sought to deconstruct binary thinking. As thinking on sex/gender evolved, the conceptual split was no longer understood as a simple separation between the biological and the social. Feminist and queer scholars problematized the distinction, reformulating it as an interlocking set of relationships: the sex/gender/sexuality system. Interdisciplinary gender scholars, including prominent feminist scientists, began theorizing the complex interrelationship between sex and gender with greater sophistication in an attempt to more firmly discredit biological determinist approaches to the study of difference based on sex, gender, or sexuality. Advancing theory, research, and praxis has not only deepened understanding about a wider variety of identities, experiences, and practices around sex, gender, and sexuality but has also won greater recognition in the early 21st century for them.

In the etiology of certain neuroses, social factors may be as important as sexual factors. This is the case of `class neurosis'. The analysis of this form of neurosis originated in a series of research and participatory groups on the theme of `family novels and social trajectories'. The study of `life histories' is a sociological method insofar as the development of social relationships may be traced through individual histories, and it is a clinical method insofar as the participants use this knowledge to gain a better understanding of their own destinies.",sociology

10.1177/0011392119869051,"As newly elected President of the International Sociological Association, I unfold my vision for new directions for global sociology. After defining what a global sociology is, I will point out two particular directions for this sociology: supplementing the postcolonial approach with an anti-authoritarian one, and theorizing post-secular society. One cannot but acknowledge the scars of the colonial era, but postcolonial studies have been rightly used but also abused. I would identify two abuses: the over-emphasis on external factors while neglecting local ones, and the binary logic of antagonistic categories such as East/West, universalism/contextualism. Thus, I make the call to supplement the postcolonial approach with an anti-authoritarian one. There are three levels of authoritarianism: one relates to the political regime; another relates rather to neoliberalism; and the third concerns attitudes. The authoritarian attitude is closely related to the difficulty of dealing with religion in our society. Global sociology should take into account in any contemporary analysis of society the new features of our post-secular society, a sort of low-key secularism in confluence with neoliberalism. In light of these two directions, I would like to see global sociology moving forward. But what should the features of this global sociology be? The article will discuss five features for global sociology.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0127,"<p>Gender operates at all levels of social life and is deeply embedded in how work is organized, rewarded, and experienced. The sociological study of gender and work emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, as women’s labor force participation rates rose and as the Women’s Movement began calling attention to gender inequality at home and on the job. The field has evolved over time; conceptual frameworks have expanded and empirical foci have shifted in response to economic and societal changes. Early research focused primarily on workers and sought to determine whether and how men and women differ in their work attitudes and behavior. Over time, researchers have paid more attention to the social relations of work. Studies here focus on how the structure and culture of the workplace shape men’s and women’s social interactions and behavior. A more recent stream of literature in the gender and work area views gender as embedded within work structures and organizations. In this view, gender is not just an attribute that people bring with them to the job, but is built into the workplace itself. The development of new conceptual frameworks has been accompanied by new issues and topics. For example, the rise of the highly feminized service sector prompted an interest in the distinctive characteristics of these jobs. As dual-earner families became the norm, researchers increased attention to the ways that gender shapes work-family relations. Other topics, such as those related to gender discrimination and inequality, have been of interest to gender and work scholars since the field’s emergence in the 1960s.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0266,"<p>Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is an approach developed in the field of science and technology studies (STS) to avoid purely social and purely technical explanations for scientific and technological developments. ANT offers the departure point of symmetrical constructivism, where there are no primordially social or technical domains, only socio-technical hybrids. As such, ANT is a crucial instigator of a wider turn away from human-centric perspectives in social research. ANT decenters humans by offering an ontological outlook where all actors, humans included, are constituted through their heterogeneous relations with other entities. According to ANT, agency is not a human privilege, but something that emerges in networks of relations between humans and nonhuman alike, thus the name actor-network theory. ANT emerged in France and the United Kingdom in the early 1980s and its influence on STS in the following decades is hard to overestimate. Early ANT brought forward relational, processual, and constructivist studies of scientific practices and technological development. Since around 1990, ANT has been taken up in a wide range of contexts, as the thematic sections below illustrate. This broadening is sometimes associated with the label post-ANT, which signifies a more explicit engagement with the entanglements of multiple practical ontologies, and ethical and political concerns in ANT research, often in conversation with feminist STS and other post-structuralist approaches in the humanities and social sciences. Today, ANT approaches are at work across many scholarly disciplines and fields, where ANT tends to play the role of a heterodox and sometimes even implicit background rather than an explicit theoretical or methodological school. In response to this, the present annotated bibliography seeks to strike a balance between guiding the reader toward classic ANT texts and including some of the trajectories of research that have followed on from ANT in more or less manifest ways. It is not uncommon to omit the label of ANT even in key ANT texts. For example, a central contributor such as Michel Callon refers to the “sociology of translation” instead of ANT. As this lack of fixed vocabulary illustrates, defining the boundaries of the ANT literature is a never-ending task that only has temporary, partial solutions. The aim of this bibliography is not to claim exhaustiveness, but to provide a solid guide for students and researchers who need starting points, either for engaging with ANT in general, or for encountering work within their specific fields of study that have engaged with ANT.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0089,"<p>The prevalence of wage labor has been a defining characteristic of modern societies. Following the Industrial Revolution, the people who sold their labor for survival in the newly emerging modern societies were usually labeled as the “working class” or the “proletariat.” Originally used by Romans to label citizens with very little or no property, the term “proletariat” was adopted by Karl Marx to categorize the working class in the newly industrialized European societies, and since then the two terms have been used interchangeably. The initial dominance of industrial work made the working class synonymous with manual work. However, as service-sector employment expanded and the number of people employed in white-collar occupations increased, the definition of “working class” also changed. Today, although there are serious debates and disagreements about the definition of “working class,” or even its very existence, many scholars define the term as comprising people who earn their living through wage labor, who do not own any assets or capital, and who do not possess workplace authority. Over the years, scholars have argued that working classes differ from the rest of the societies they belong to with their politics, culture, family structures, and the conditions they live in. However, it is also not possible to talk about a single and unified working class in any society, as working classes are divided through the lines of gender, race, and ethnicity. Today, working classes all over the world are struggling with the challenges of globalization and new technologies, although the specific challenges they face differ in developed and less developed countries.</p>",sociology

It has become a focal point in the analysis of a variety of sociological questions, as well as in broader public and policy debates. The conceptual framework of citizenship in the work of T. H. Marshall (see Marshall 1950, cited under Historical Origins and Trajectories), whether endorsed or critically appraised, constitutes the starting point for much of the scholarship on citizenship. Inspired by Marshall, the scholarship shifted away from a purely legal understanding of citizenship to include concerns about social and economic inclusion, and later to questions of belonging and participation. Predominant conceptions of citizenship denote (a) membership in a polity (the nation-state), (b) a set of rights and duties that this membership carries with it, and (c) exercise of rights and obligations, and participation in the polity by members. National citizenship, the rights and duties it entails, and the identity it professes have come under significant duress as a result of the global hegemony of political and economic liberalism, particularly since the collapse of the polarized world system. Much of the work in the sociology of citizenship has developed in response to these global challenges. While a significant number of studies occupy themselves with the changing individual and collective relationship in the welfare state and in the broader context of human rights, others focus on questions of belonging and participation in a world where nation-state boundaries can no longer be taken for granted. More recently, attention has also been given to the growing global inequalities and populist reactions.

What is commonly understood as feminist theory accompanied the feminist movement in the mid-seventies, though there are key texts from the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries that represent early feminist thought. Whereas feminist theories first began as an attempt to explain women’s oppression globally, following a grand theoretical approach akin to Marxism, the questions and emphases in the field have undergone some major shifts. Two primary shifts have been (1) from universalizing to particularizing and contextualizing women’s experiences and (2) from conceptualizing men and women as categories and focusing on the category “women” to questioning the content of that category, and moving to the exploration of gendered practices. Thus, while many theorists do focus on the question of how gender inequality manifests in institutions such as the workplace, home, armed forces, economy, or public sphere, others explore the range of practices that have come to be defined as masculine or feminine and how gender is constituted in relation to other social relations. Feminist theories can thus be used to explain how institutions operate with normative gendered assumptions and selectively reward or punish gendered practices. Many contemporary feminists look beyond the United States to focus on the effects of transnational economic, political, and cultural linkages on shaping gender.</p>",sociology

This is pursued by way of a comparison of the assumptions and norms of social capital and political culture theory - the latter being a perspective that shaped post-war political analysis. The second part of the article situates social capital in relation to the Foucauldian literature on government.

Second, global sociology, paying special attention to southern theory and the “epistemologies of the south.” Along with the struggles for the decolonization of the university, this process is redefining the field in non-Eurocentric terms, locating histories of colonialism, enslavement, appropriation, and dispossession at the center of modernity; and interrogating as well epistemic violence/injustice in relation to the constitution of sociology as a discipline. Finally, decolonial struggles taking place outside the university, led by Indigenous and Black peoples and communities. These struggles usually understand the concept and praxis of decolonization in ways that exceed the “social justice framework.” Thus, they allow us to free ourselves from a modern/Eurocentric horizon of liberation, and to transform our sociological and political imagination accordingly.",sociology

Bachelard, Piaget and Bhaskar furnish elements that account better, both factually and normatively, for the coupling of empirical data and theory in the sciences in general and in sociology in particular, than Alexander's, Popper's and Kuhn's perspectives.

Consequently, this body of research provides insight into how we might challenge and overcome inequality, more generally. A second area examines animal abuse and questions entrenched assumptions about the link between cruelty to animals and violence directed toward humans. This research also reveals that animals are often victims and pawns in domestic violence. A third area uses human–animal interaction to challenge dominant sociological views of the self. By doing so, this work expands our knowledge of what it means to live in a social world. Overall, the scholarly work within the field of animals and society suggests that the inclusion of animals in sociological research can expand and clarify existing theories and concepts.",sociology

               This chapter explores the interface between sociology and social justice by bringing into dialogue three intellectual and political projects that are reshaping the frontiers of sociological praxis at different levels. First, collaborative research methodologies, which bridge theory and action by working and thinking together with our coresearchers around jointly conceived agendas/problems. For research and knowledge to matter, they must be rooted in collective struggles for social justice. Second, global sociology, paying special attention to southern theory and the “epistemologies of the south.” Along with the struggles for the decolonization of the university, this process is redefining the field in non-Eurocentric terms, locating histories of colonialism, enslavement, appropriation, and dispossession at the center of modernity; and interrogating as well epistemic violence/injustice in relation to the constitution of sociology as a discipline. Finally, decolonial struggles taking place outside the university, led by Indigenous and Black peoples and communities. These struggles usually understand the concept and praxis of decolonization in ways that exceed the “social justice framework.” Thus, they allow us to free ourselves from a modern/Eurocentric horizon of liberation, and to transform our sociological and political imagination accordingly.",sociology

They interpret and analyze Ibn Khaldun’s philosophy of history, social theory, and sociological doctrines, not only by stressing their modern relevance, but also by demonstrating how they could be employed to forge a new reading of the social sciences. Thus, Alatas’s methodology applies Ibn Khaldun’s seemingly dated theories and concepts to modern sociological and historical thought, while avoiding anachronisms in either interpretation or meaning. This essay is organized thematically, and the first section explores Ibn Khadun’s key classical concepts of ‘asabiyya, nomadic, and sedentary from a social science perspective. The second section elaborates on how Weber’s three ideal types of authority (charismatic, traditional, rational-legal) could be applied to Ibn Khaldun’s reading of Muslim society in his own time and afterwards, and Alatas includes the Weberian distinction between functional and value rationality. The third section applies the classical distinction between authority and power to caliphate authority and kingship.

By continuing to employ a primary conceptualisation, there is a danger of developing a radically misinformed, even corrupt, perspective on the recent `rise' in corruption.

The article suggests two strategies for analysing the relationship between social capital theory and conceptions of liberal-democratic government. In the first section the concept of social capital is interrogated in terms of its political imagination. This is pursued by way of a comparison of the assumptions and norms of social capital and political culture theory - the latter being a perspective that shaped post-war political analysis. The second part of the article situates social capital in relation to the Foucauldian literature on government.

If this does not happen, the process of dysfunctional disturbances in the systems becomes irreversible, and stagnant and negative phenomena become social facts.  From the author's point of view, the task of the sociology of restructuring consists in revealing concrete mechanisms for the coordination of system qualities (those existing, being improved or newly created) and the individual social and psychological qualities of personalities, revealing mechanisms contributing to the optimal combination of objective and subjective, general and individual factors for the social and economic development of the country.",sociology

He attended high school in Winnipeg and entered the University of Manitoba in 1939, majoring in natural sciences. However, his interests shifted toward the social sciences before he left in 1942, still some credits short of his degree. He returned to study at Toronto in 1944, obtaining a BA degree in 1945. That fall he began studies toward the MA degree in sociology at the University of Chicago. Initially influenced by W. Lloyd Warner, his 1949 master’s thesis gave an ethnographic analysis of the responses of cosmopolitan middle-class women as they refused to take entirely seriously the demands of the Thematic Apperception Test that Goffman administered. His doctoral dissertation, “Communication Conduct in an Island Community” (1953), was based on fieldwork in the Shetland Islands sponsored by the University of Edinburgh’s Social Anthropology department. In it Goffman first introduced the term “interaction order” to describe the domain of social life established by co-present persons. This was the sociological terrain he made his own. The investigation of the properties of the interaction order provided the thread that ran through the disparate topic-matters of his eleven books and more than a dozen significant journal articles. Goffman stayed another year in Chicago following the successful defense of his dissertation, drafting an original monograph (The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, first published in 1956 in Edinburgh) and papers on face-work, embarrassment, involvement, and deference and demeanor. Between the end of 1954 and 1957 he worked as a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health, conducting the fieldwork and writing that led to Asylums (1961).

Mead: A Critical Introduction, which has the twofold goal of introducing Mead's thought to a new generation of scholars and inspiring a scholarly debate concerning the significance of his work in modern social science. The discussion acknowledges the originality of Da Silva's conception of Mead's thought as a system that develops in and through a dialogue with other thinkers. Nevertheless, this dialogue is shown to be inadequate as a strategy for reconstructing Mead's social psychology, which did not rely solely upon philosophy and psychology. The focus is brought to bear on Da Silva's uncritical acceptance of authoritative opinion concerning the main sources of Mead's inspiration, among which not even a single sociologist is mentioned. The essay argues, on the one hand, that Blumer's symbolic interactionism compressed two quite different traditions into one — a view adequately supported by evidence. Meadian scholarship then continued to conflate and subsume under `Mead' what may be termed the micro-sociopsychological tradition, as found in the pioneering works of Cooley, and what may be termed the macro-sociopsychological tradition of Mead himself, to which the former gave impetus. The essay also maintains that the origin of Mead's theory cannot be properly understood outside its indebtedness to the sociological climate in America at the turn of the 20th century, which was conditioned by the social and psychological ideas of such thinkers as Jane Addams and Freud. The conclusion is drawn that if the relationship between symbolic interactionism and modern social theory is to be understood, then the area of research should be extended from the main canonical gallery, in which Mead deservedly has a place, to what may be described as the `minor sociological gallery' of Simmel, Tarde, Addams and Cooley, which at present remains in the background.",sociology

An argument is made that Goffman followed the lead of his mentor, Everett Hughes, in casting social institutions as “going concerns” that run the gamut from large scale formal organizations to taken-for-granted collective enterprises which are honored in the breach. Several empirical studies developing Goffman’s theory of total institutions are reviewed to flesh out his brand of structural interactionism. The paper concludes with reflections on the retroactive nature of reconstructing a school’s origins, problematic practice of assigning sociologists to a specific paradigm, and the affinity of Goffman’s sociology with the classical inquiry into a dialectical relationship between agency and structure. The case is made that Goffman’s research on the institutional moorings of human subjectivity places him firmly in the classic sociological canon and forms the core of his intellectual legacy.",sociology

Less work has gone into developing analytic categories that allow us to capture the complex imbrications of technology and society. This article addresses two particular aspects of this challenge through two organizing efforts. First, understanding the place of these new technologies from a sociological perspective requires avoiding a purely technological interpretation and recognizing the embeddedness and the variable outcomes of these technologies for different social orders. These technologies can indeed be constitutive of new social dynamics, but they can also be derivative or merely reproduce older conditions. Second, such an effort will, in turn, call for categories that capture what are now often conceived of as contradictory, or mutually exclusive, attributes. The article examines these two aspects by focusing on three analytic issues for sociology: the embeddedness of the new technologies, the complex interactions between the digital and the material world, and the mediating cultures that organize the relation between these technologies and users.",sociology

It is marked by the emphasis on social processes, human agency and the dimension of time. These aspects of social reality become central foci of 'new historism' or 'historical sociology'. With the ascendance of this new trend the relationship of sociology and history enters a third phase: after initial hostility and mutual stereotyping through attempts at external integration, it reaches a phase of immanent integration. From ahistorism typical of early nineteenth century European sociology, as well as early American sociology, our discipline moves gradually toward the recognition of the historical coeflicient of social phenomena, and accordingly the necessity of historical perspective in social studies. Historical orientation is recon structed as a set of six ontological and six methodological assumptions, and it is suggested as a fruitful approach not only to traditional macro-structural problems, but also to the domain of micro-structures and micro-processes.",sociology

I illustrate how men's diverse institutional roles surrounding medicalized experiences of infertility are critical for understanding inequality in reproduction. Situating research on men and infertility in the theoretical framework of gender as social structure shows how men's secondary position in reproduction can be seen across institutional roles, which include men as patients, men as partners, men as sperm donors, and men as doctors. Men's experiences with reproductive medicine often reinforce men's marginal position in reproductive medicine through institutionalized arrangements; yet, men are intimately and structurally involved in reproductive decisions. I argue that bringing gender to the center of research on infertility could make clear the many structural ways women and women's bodies are controlled, regulated, and treated by reproductive medicine.",sociology

First of all, the phenomenon of digital society is characterised and defined. Its specificity is revealed. Then the transition is made directly to the phenomenon of culture of digital society. The main objective of this article is to show connection between the concept of culture of digital society and sociological theories of culture. To achieve it, the article provides a review of sociological theories of culture. In particular, the theories of P.A. Sorokin, T. Parsons and M.S. Archer are considered. The article demonstrates the specifics of the culture of digital society. The historical stages of development of this phenomenon are highlighted. A trend towards digitalisation of public life is identified. Next, the concept of culture of digital society is discussed directly. The final part of the article emphasises the connections between the culture of digital society and general sociological theories of culture. Finally, new research questions regarding further study and conceptualisation of the culture of digital society are posed. In conclusion, the author accentuates the necessity to conduct empirical research on specific and general cases related to the studied concept.",sociology

In countries such as the UK, the funding of research in social science and other subjects has become increasingly dependent on the perception that research will contribute towards the achievement of certain national goals. Despite renewed discussions surrounding the utility of social analysis, these are rarely informed by debates in academic communities about the meaning of `relevance' or associated debates about the status of knowledge. However divergent policy and academic discussions about relevance may appear, they intersect in concerns over the identity of researchers, the practices of research, and the claims made on behalf of research.

Researchers appear to be obsessed with what are mistakenly seen as cosmopolitan issues.  The author identifies a number of different perspectives from which one can explore the possible future of the sociology of work: the organization of the profession, its academic-scientific structure, and trends in work and in social demand for the discipline.  The author argues that to ensure a positive future for both the sociology of work and the societies in which it is practised, sociology must regain its role in the definition of sociological problems and so prevent the conscious ideological trivialization of the discipline. He also argues the case for continual theoretical reconstruction and epistemological vigilance so that sociology can define its theoretical field and identify possible paths towards a greater social role for the discipline.",sociology

In much anthropological and sociological writings, things have mainly been considered in two ways: either as commodities or as gifts. Correspondingly, people's relationships to things and to other people seem to fall in two broad categories, often regarded as mutually exclusive: either as impersonal, economic or market relationships with strangers, or as personal gift relationships with intimates, friends or relatives. The `social life of things', however, is more varied. Drawing on Alan Page Fiske's theory of the four fundamental models of human relationship, four ways in which people may relate to each other and to things are distinguished; these models are applied to empirical data from a study on the giving of gifts in the Netherlands.

Sociologists with even fleeting awareness of the recent history of political sociology are surely familiar with the cultural turn, the global turn, and the turn toward complexity; however, another turn seems to be afoot, one toward existential concerns that direct us to recover how people experience ‘the complex contradictions of the social and political world’ (Taylor, The New Political Sociology, p. 197). Complex experiences often leave behind residues or ‘traces,’ and contributors in a recently edited volume challenge sociologists to unlock the social significance of these traces and find new ways to capture what our methods capture so poorly, namely, popular forgettings, geographies of exclusion, and the slow erasure of deeds, memories, and other subjugated knowledges belonging to individuals who find themselves dismissed, dispelled, or disenfranchised by nation-states. Traces left behind by individuals navigating the complexities of contemporary experiments in human ‘being’ are just the sort of analysis that must, in principle, place the actor at the center of analysis, and, after careful study, we now appreciate that despite the analytical ease of assuming that actors are singular, sociologists should examine actors as plural and unearth their essential multiplicity.",sociology

These experiments engage with Pierre Bourdieu as a Buddhist quantum physicist, Emile Durkheim as a New Age transpersonal psychologist, and Michel Foucault as a daemon-inspired revolutionary. The three experiments illustrate that, while many worlds (consisting of objective and subjective structures) exist, they tend to collapse into a few through “echo effects” produced by the powerful; these powerful echo effects are counteracted by the evolution of Spirit or Collective Consciousness growing more enlightened; and the more individuals reconnect with Spirit, the more echo effects are transformed into resonances, pointing to the pluriversal future that permits many worlds to co-flourish. This spiritual–sociological experimentation not only articulates an immanent–transcendent critique of modernity (or any society), but also suggests that contemplative practice be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate education because the quality of sociological research depends fundamentally on that of the researcher's mind.",sociology

The main methodological foundations of application of Bayesian approach in statistics are briefly reviewed: the use of priors in analysis, features of Bayesian statistical inference, differences in frequency and Bayesian confidence intervals, features of hypothesis testing in Bayesian statistics. A Bayesian model of a comparative binomial experiment has been constructed. It supports comparison of independent and dependent samples of binomial variables, and also allows for differences in sizes of the compared samples. The capabilities of the model, as well as the principles of the Bayesian hypothesis testing, were demonstrated on test data using PyMC and ArviZ, contemporary free packages of the Bayesian modeling and analysis. The use of these tools allows implementing direct tensor operations with the obtained posterior distributions and provides the researcher with an effective way to calculate the effect size when comparing two binomial samples without having to resort to complicated forms of calculating this parameter. The possibilities and limitations of the Bayesian approach are shown in the context of comparative analysis of the results of binomial experiments in social sciences by estimating the probability of hypotheses via finding and comparing the area of intervals of posterior distributions",sociology

This adjunct work of women, it is argued, facilitates the `fleeting encounter' of professional practice, thereby resting on, and celebrating, a specific historical and cultural construction of masculinity and a masculinist vision of professional work.

Despite their significant role in the processes of neighborhood communication and the construction of local communities, this phenomenon has been little comprehended by social science. The purpose of this article is to offer variants of adaptation of some sociological approaches to the analysis of the phenomenon of neighborhood chats. The nature of neighborhood chat as an institutional and communication-oriented tool for information exchange is described. The classification of neighborhood chats according to the level of their closeness is given. The forms of control in the selection of participants in closed versions of neighborhood chats are explained. The communicative side of neighborhood chat is proposed to be considered through the prism of E. Goffman’s “dramaturgy”. Conceptualizations of the basic concepts of “dramaturgy” in the context of digital neighborhood interaction are proposed. The complicated nature of neighborhood chat as a technological and social phenomenon is analyzed using the actor-network theory approach. The identification of neighborhood chat as an “actor-network” has been substantiated. The functional side of neighborhood chat as a mechanism of assemblage of neighborhood communities is considered in correlation with R. Oldenburg’s concept of the “third place”. It is shown that the neighborhood chat, being rather a digital simulation of the “third place”, can potentially compensate for the lack of real public spaces in the conditions of typical development, launching and supporting the processes of integration on the locality.",sociology

Marx's critique of the ahistorical errors and alternative emphasis on the historical character of social system constitute the theoretical unifying theme of his social studies.

Environmental sociology has been described as comprising four major areas of research. First, environmental sociologists study the social causes of environmental problems. Along these lines, scholars have developed an array of theoretical frameworks to explain how various social factors, including demographic, social, cultural, political, economic, and technological dynamics, generate environmental impacts and problems, and they have conducted many empirical studies on a wide range of environmental indicators to assess hypotheses derived from these theories. Second, environmental sociology is concerned with how the natural environment influences and impacts society. Early environmental sociologists strongly emphasized the dependence of human societies on the natural environment and stressed that the field should consider how the environment shapes society in addition to how society impacts the environment. Research in this area tackles issues such as the social consequences of natural disasters and the inequitable distribution of environmental hazards along racial and socioeconomic lines. Third, environmental sociology examines social reactions and responses to environmental threats and problems. Research in this area focuses on understanding patterns and trends in environmental attitudes and behaviors (e.g., recycling) as well as various aspects of the environmental movement. Fourth, environmental sociologists are concerned with understanding social processes and dynamics that could advance environmental reform and sustainability. In general, environmental sociology has tended to focus more on explaining how society causes environmental problems while paying less attention to potential solutions, but a shift has taken place in recent decades. The development, discussion, and empirical assessment of theories of environmental reform, analyses of potential solutions to environmental crises, and drafting of conceptual frameworks for sustainability have become important foci of scholarly activity in environmental sociology. Another major area of research, one that cuts across the preceding four, is the human dimensions of global climate change, which has become one of the main substantive issues studied by environmental sociologists. In this article, important scholarly works in each of these five areas are highlighted and briefly discussed, along with a selection of the most relevant textbooks, handbooks and collections, encyclopedia and review articles that provide general overviews of the field, and academic journals that publish environmental sociology research.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0203,"<p>Beginning with many of its earliest writings, sociology has a long tradition of theorizing the role of objects and material culture in social life. In the middle of the 20th century, these themes were taken up again by major sociological and anthropological thinkers who inspired a resurgence of interest in the study of objects. The sociology of culture and art began to address the production and reception of objects, while scholars from anthropology, cultural studies, and media studies began to develop a robust body of work around material culture. These two fields have somewhat different takes on the study of objects. Sociological accounts tend to be people focused, examining how institutional characteristics of art worlds shape the objects produced, and focusing explanations of meaning-making on the social position of the audience more so than the symbolic qualities of the object. Alternatively, material culture approaches tend to be object focused, engaging objects as symbols that help explain how people organize subcultures, create solidarity through exchange, or express social status. A turn toward materiality, originating from anthropology but taken up more recently in sociology, privileges the material qualities of objects and how they shape the use and symbolic meaning of objects. This work on objects raises the question of how sociologists should incorporate objects into accounts of action. This question has sparked an ongoing cross-disciplinary debate about whether objects have agency. Research in science and technology studies, alongside studies of craft and sport, have brought attention to how objects act back, shaping how knowledge is produced. Objects have also been understood as mechanisms of power, by shaping categories and morality, ritualizing icons, stabilizing social relations as instruments of the states and institutions, and structuring action through the built environment. These robust and vibrant areas of research make a strong case for the incorporation of objects into theories of power and knowledge.</p>",sociology

Thinking is typically seen as something intensely private and fleeting in nature, two qualities that make it resistant to sociology’s efforts to get a grip on it. Earlier attempts to make a sociological analysis of thinking are surveyed, from Durkheim over the sociology of knowledge to today’s sociology of ideas and other approaches. An argument is made that a sociology of thinking could get some important inspiration from philosophy, especially when it comes to topics to analyze and the setting of an agenda. To exemplify this argument, some writings on thinking by Kant, Kierkegaard, and Heidegger are presented. The paper ends with some reflections on the normative dimension of thinking and a sociology of thinking.",sociology

In order to do so, we demonstrate how connections between different ‘sensory worlds’ involve equivocal understandings about what the ‘social’ entails. We begin by considering current anthropological reflections on the equivocal character of social relations as well as the equivocal ways in which western sociology has conceptualized the ‘social’. In order to visualize how ‘equivocal connections’ between different sensory worlds emerge, we build on Mapuche indigenous understandings about how different practices open up different sensory worlds. Through the examination of one of the hunger strikes that has taken place in the conflict between Mapuche people and the Chilean state, we show how such equivocal connections entail ontological, rather than epistemological, differences. Both as ethical and epistemological imperative, these differences must be actively demonstrated in order to reinvigorate the sociological imagination.",sociology
10.1177/0011392120907639,"Academic disciplines are defined not primarily by their object but by their (theoretical and methodological) approach to that object, and by their claim to a monopoly over it. Even where that monopoly claim has been highly successful, it remains contestable. For example, economics, perhaps in this respect the most successful social science, finds its object – the economy – contested by political economists and economic sociologists. Whereas economics has successfully marginalized potential competitors, sociology has remained a broad church. Attempts to impose theoretical and methodological order on the discipline have met with resistance, and eventually failed. Moreover, sociology has never really reached consensus on what its object is; ‘society’, ‘social facts’, ‘social action’ were the classical options, with the list growing over time (social networks, rational action, actor networks, etc.). Thus, while we can speak of ‘heterodox economics’ there is insufficient orthodoxy to speak of ‘heterodox sociology’. This has an obverse side. Precisely because of the weakness of its monopolistic claims, sociology has been very productive in spawning new disciplinary fields, which, rather than remaining within sociology’s weak gravitational pull, successfully establish themselves as separate disciplines or ‘studies’. Criminology, industrial relations, urban studies and organization studies are the most obvious examples. In light of this, this article addresses two questions: (1) What happens to these new fields when they break free of the parent discipline, and to the parent discipline when they do? (2) If one effect on the ‘offspring’ is a loss of disciplinary orientation (as the rationale for this special issue suggests) what, if anything, has contemporary sociology to offer OS as a potential source of reorientation?",sociology

Worldwide people have had to manage the experience of an uncertain new threat under very different conditions. A growing body of research and theoretical approaches tries to make sense of the social responses to the pandemic. This monograph issue contributes to the research on the first wave of the pandemic from the perspective of the sociology of risk and uncertainty. This includes a number of key topics such as care workers’ experiences in the Netherlands, stigmatisation and Othering in India, the multidimensionality of social inequalities in the experience of confinement in Argentina, mourning practices in Iran, discourses of legitimacy in Sweden, distrust in government in Hong Kong, risk communication in the UK, and fake news in social media. This introduction sets these contributions in the broader context of key debates in the sociology of risk and uncertainty such as rational, in-between and non-rational approaches to risk in everyday life, the Othering of social groups, the multidimensionality of risk and inequality, the debate about methodological cosmopolitanism, the discursive construction of legitimacy, the significance of (dis)trust for public engagement with risk, shortcomings in risk communication, and framing of fake news and conspiracy theories.

No longer a stepchild of the serious business of sociologists, the arts are, if not central, then at least a legitimate, as opposed to a frivolous subject. This flowering has come about despite a traditional anti-aesthetic orientation in American social science, and, until recently, relative retarded development of much contemporary European social science. Still, the position of the arts in the social science disciplines is likely to remain tenuous, and requires renewed justification as an intellectual enterprise. The reasons for this have to do both with the intellectual outlooks that have become embedded in understandings of the arts, and the social structures of their creation – or ‘production.’ The most promising developments in sociology are fostered by recognition of many more genres of creativity and their incorporation in the aesthetic domain.

Despite major differences in their political and scientific outlook, both argued against the encroachments of the social sciences into the field of legal studies. This article shows how Kelsen mounted a polemic against Durkheim, on the basis of a first-hand knowledge of his writings. Kelsen believed that Durkheim committed several errors. In particular, he interpreted Durkheim’s famous sentence according to which ‘social facts must be treated as things’ as a clear sign of a materialistic, deterministic and positivistic attitude which neglects the power of ideas and norms. Schmitt targeted sociology by way of a criticism not of Durkheim but of Léon Duguit, who had been inspired by Durkheim and pleaded for a collaboration between legal scholars and social scientists.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of conceptual frameworks which relate sociological theory to a thinking about ‘the visual.’ Sociological theory has widely neglected to reflect on images and ‘the visual’ and to explore the role of images in constituting and reproducing ‘the social’. This article argues for a sociology of images. It aims to develop a conceptual tool to analyse images from a practice perspective. Following a theory of practice approach and referring to works in the sociology of science, it suggests the concept of ‘visual logic’ to analyse images sociologically. The article claims that social practice is intertwined with a visual logic. To investigate images from a sociological perspective, the article argues, implies to analyse the visual logic that shapes, and is constituted by, social practices. Taking medical images as an example and drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, the article shows how this concept serves as an analytical tool to explore the social role of images. Physicians and medical researchers use images both because of their visual and non-visual dimensions. The article thus concludes by pointing to a multitude of visual logics – or, in their empirical form, ‘visual rationalities’ – that become evident when observing image practices ethnographically.",sociology

10.1177/00113921241271850,"The most promising perspectives for a transdisciplinary dialogue between economics and sociology may be identified in the sub-disciplinary fields of evolutionary economics and economic sociology. Both share a common intellectual legacy in the differentiation of the social sciences. The economic and sociological work of Joseph Schumpeter provides an outstanding point of cross-disciplinary transgression and reintegration. In this context, this article claims that it is a curious fact that the role of technological and organizational innovation as a driving force of capitalist evolution characterized by disruptive change has become the paradigmatic foundation of related debates in evolutionary economics, but not in economic sociology. Of course, in economic sociology, technological change has been repeatedly covered regarding the social structures and network relations underpinning technological change in various settings of organizations, industries, markets and spaces. Yet the phenomenon of the introduction of novelty as such, drawing on constellations of power and domination in the context of radical uncertainty, enforcing the disruption and reconfiguration of social relations has remained rather underrepresented in the major strands of sociological reasoning on economic affairs. This assessment holds especially for neo-institutionalist reasoning, which emphasizes the drive towards stability in industries and markets, and therefore underestimates the actual characteristic of capitalism an innovation-driven system of persistently radical changes. Elaborating on this concern, this article outlines the basic relationship between evolutionary economics and economic sociology as point of departure for presenting the evolutionary approach to innovation as a promising concept for future reasoning in economic sociology. In conclusion, this implies that bringing innovation back into economic sociology implies a revitalization of Schumpeterian positions while entering a transdisciplinary dialogue with current advances in evolutionary economics and related fields of innovation studies.",sociology

Among them are “The Chicago School of Urban Sociology,” “Suburbanism,” “Gentrification,” “Residential Segregation,” “Community,” “Urban Economics,” “Social Movements in Cities,” and “Riots.” Given the rich disciplinary sources that feed into urban sociology, this area of inquiry probably can be best understood by the themes that allow researchers to connect the disparate kinds of studies they do. The several sections into which this essay is divided have works that reflect one or more of the following four themes: (1) Urban sociologists focus on either the physical development of urban places (i.e., urbanization) or the way of life or culture practiced there (i.e., urbanism). (2) The work of urban sociologists asks how urban places are built and laid out as cities and metropolitan areas. It also asks how urban settlements might be rebuilt or developed so they better serve or complement the way people live there. (3) Some sociologists look at smaller groups of urban dwellers or venues in urban areas such as neighborhoods (i.e., “micro” studies) and other kinds of “communities” such as those one might find in a suburb. Others look at much larger geographic landscapes such as metropolitan areas and urban regions (i.e., “macro” studies). (4) Urban sociologists can be optimistic about the prospects for urban places and people or, more frequently, pessimistic about how well they will fare. The resilience and effectiveness of people living in urban settings are more often subordinated to a view of them as part of a marginalized and less well-regarded group, surviving rather than accomplishing much in the places they live, work, and practice politics.</p>",sociology

What would a developed sociology of the moral constitution of society look like? It would firstly have to be empirical and not philosophical; secondly it would have to produce an `irritant' and thus a communicative learning process within sociology itself. The necessary condition for this is the interdiction of self-exemption. The proposed correlation between this negative condition and moral communication is refutable only if moral communication could be found signalling esteem and disesteem in which the communicator took the licence of not applying the proclaimed standards reflexively. The division of labour cannot, in itself, be the source of morality because it is ruled by self-exemption. In moral communication, the duality of ego and alter and the opposition of esteem and disesteem are translated into a binary code that opposes positive and negative values and which is acceptable to both sides of a moral dispute as a framework to which they can refer. Codes are invariant but specific; ethical programmes change historically with the structural changes of the social system. This is not to end with a sterile relativism but to make the distinction, pace Durkheim, between ethics and the sociology of moral communication.",sociology

It has become an integral part of North-South relationships and is closely linked to current processes of global social transformation. This makes it as important for sociologists to develop empirical research and analysis on forced migration as it is to include it in their theoretical understandings of contemporary society. The study of forced migration is linked to research on economic migration, but has its own specific research topics, methodological problems and conceptual issues. Forced migration needs to be analysed as a social process in which human agency and social networks play a major part. It gives rise to fears of loss of state control, especially in the context of recent concerns about migration and security. In this context, it is essential to question earlier sociological approaches, which have been based on the principle of relatively autonomous national societies. The sociology of forced migration must be a transnational and interdisciplinary undertaking.",sociology

Municipalities, states, and federal governments see culture—the goods, ideas, traditions, activities, and practices that we produce and consume—as revitalizing communities, attracting human capital and consumers, providing jobs, and boosting quality of life. While artists, support personnel, manufacturers, and patrons continue to anchor the field, because of culture’s entrée into the economic arena there has been an influx of diverse actors and institutions with various stakes and logics. These new actors with a vested interest in the field include local elected officials, small-business owners, and the creative class, as well as national nonprofits, state agencies, and commercial institutions. With the emergence of creativity as an economic growth strategy, there has been a great deal of analysis on the cultural economy in a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to sociology, economics, public policy, city and regional planning, and urban studies.

Enthralled by the potential of research films and having made three films so far, the author believes that this medium offers great opportunities for sociologists. As a powerful means of communication with its tremendous appeal to sociologists and the public alike, research films have a future as an effective tool of data collection like surveys and interviews. But this largely depends upon the readiness of sociologists to make use of the medium of film in their research, by sparing some of their time to learn the necessary skills of filming and editing. Making research films is as rigorous as writing a research paper or a book, and it offers a great deal of satisfaction and pleasure to the sociologist-filmmaker. Against a backdrop of the production of the author's own research films, this article looks at the relevance of the medium to present sociological concepts and theses, the work associated with the production of a research film, the skills that can be learned to produce a movie without relying on film professionals, and the impact that it can have on the career of sociologists in the near future.",sociology

When manifesting a vocation, the sociologist is not an acting subject but part of an unfolding presence. Understood vocationally, then, sociology should not be taught as an object with which students are to identify; it must be taught through ascetic practices that suspend the student sociologist’s subjectivity and allow them to find their potential through their relation with an other that is different but not outside. The emphasis should be not on the student’s comprehension of sociological content but on the ethics of their encounter; the discipline of vocational sociology is not based on the desire of subjectification but on love.",sociology

We make the argument for sociologies of race that go beyond surface level reconstructions, and which challenge sociologists to reflect on how their discipline is presently configured. What the suite of papers in this collection shows is both the resilience of race as a construct for organising social relations and the slippery fashion in which ideas of race have shifted, transmuted and pluralised. It is in a spirit of recognising continuity and change that we present this collection. Some of the papers already stand as landmark essays, while others exemplify key moments in the broader teleology of race studies. This includes articles that explore the ontological ground upon which ideas of race, citizenship and black identity have been fostered and the need to develop a global sociology that is critically reflexive of its western orientation. The theme of continuity and change can be seen in papers that showcase intersectional approaches to race, where gender, nationality, generation and class offer nuanced readings of everyday life, alongside the persistence of institutional forms of discrimination. As this work demonstrates, middle-class forms of whiteness often go ‘hiding in the light’ yet can be made visible if we consider how parental school choice, or selecting where to live are also recognised as racially informed decisions. The range and complexity of these debates not only reflect the vitality of race in the contemporary period but lead us to ask not so much if race ends here, but where?",sociology

Additional mechanisms that serve to develop college students' financial literacy include parent socialization, banking experience, and high school financial education programs.

It became possible to develop and express ideas with relative freedom, i.e., controlled by the state in order to halt the rapid dissolution of the ecological and social fabric. Sociologists were in demand to start empirical research, especially on social crises and public opinion. A somewhat technocratic version of sociology focussing on the economy and social stratification came to be officially tolerated as a major contribution to stabilising the remaining Soviet state policy in the period of perestroika.  With the total collapse of the Soviet empire, however, this imperial sociology has lost its raison d'être. The vacuum left by the demise of the empire, in which a civil society has not yet developed, is parallelled by an intellectual vacuum in post-totalitarian sociology.

It suggested this would be a selfreinforcing process unless there were far-reaching changes in undergraduate curricula which were unlikely to come about. It predicted that the divide between these aspects of British sociology and that practised in North America and many parts of Europe would widen further.

Some scholars emphasize that work–life balance requires balancing demands of both paid work and family responsibilities or maximizing satisfaction by minimizing conflict between paid work and family responsibilities. Others view work–life balance as encompassing the way that boundaries blur between work, family, and leisure time. In attempting to address work–life balance, workers are generally trying to preserve both quality of life, and potential for career advancements, while employers are trying to preserve high productivity and reduce worker turnover. Although the term “work–life balance” is widely used, alternative terms are also employed, such as work–family balance, work–life integration, work–life harmonization, or work–life articulation. Research on attempts to manage paid work along with family and other parts of life has been carried out for decades. Yet this scholarship has exploded in the last two decades, particularly as middle-class women have increased their workforce participation, but also work is being carried out during nonstandard hours, technology is creating more permeability between work and home, and union protections have been weakened. Work–life balance efforts may lead to poor-quality jobs in terms of earnings, job security, working time and promotion opportunities, rather than long-term quality employment over the life course that allows for leisure and family time. Research on work–life balance should take structural, rather than individual approaches, to consider workplace cultures, including by occupation and gender inequality, and recognize the different assumptions underlying policies aimed at addressing work–life balance.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0240,"<p>Causal inference is a growing interdisciplinary subfield in statistics, computer science, economics, epidemiology, and the social sciences. In contrast with both traditional quantitative methods and cutting-edge approaches like machine learning, causal inference questions are defined in relation to potential outcomes, or variable values that are counterfactual to the observed world and therefore cannot be answered from joint probabilities alone, even with infinite data. The fact that one can possibly observe at most one potential outcome among those of interest is known as the “fundamental problem of causal inference.” For example, in this framework, the economic return to college education can be defined as a comparison between two potential outcomes: the wages of an individual with a college education versus the wages that the same individual would have received had he or she not attended college. In general, researchers are interested in estimating such effects for certain groups and comparing the effects for different subpopulations. Critical to causal inference is recognizing that, to answer causal questions from observed data, one has to rely on untestable assumptions about how the data were generated. In other words, there is no particular statistical method that would render a conclusion “causal”; the validity of such an interpretation depends on a combination of data, assumptions about the data-generating process based on expert judgment, and estimation techniques. In the last several decades, our understanding of causality has improved enormously, owing to a conceptual apparatus and a mathematical language that enables rigorous conceptualization of causal quantities and formal representation of causal assumptions, while still employing familiar statistical methods. Potential outcomes or the Neyman-Rubin causal model and structural equations encoded as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs, also known as structural causal models) are two common approaches for conceptualizing causal relationships. The symbiosis of both languages offers a powerful framework to address causal questions. This review covers developments in both causal identification (i.e., deciding if a quantity of interest would be recoverable from infinite data, based on our assumptions) and causal effect estimation (i.e., the use of statistical methods to approximate that answer with finite, although potentially big, data). The literature is presented following the type of assumptions and questions frequently encountered in empirical research, ending with a discussion of promising new directions in the field.</p>",sociology

After exploring different forms of violence and discussing the impoverishment which affects the region, the authors suggest that the spread of violence and crime is influenced by forces of global and local transformation which cause that violence to transcend national boundaries while reflecting the particular characteristics of each locality's culture and social organization. Through an analysis of five related processes: (1) changes in the drug economy; (2) proliferation of firearms; (3) similarity of cultural patterns of violence; (4) generalized fear among the population; and (5) citizen support for retaliation and extralegal violence (the latter in dangerous rapid expansion), the authors conclude by asserting that the appropriation of violence and its implacable logic of escalation can only lead to reciprocal annihilation. The strengthening of the state and the restoration of the rule of law comprise the necessary alternative for defending people's integrity and regaining freedom in the city.",sociology

It suggests that the starting point for doing global sociology is to deconstruct the inherent Eurocentrism which is there in the discipline’s cognitive frames. Also, it suggests that Eurocentrism is not merely represented in sociological theories and methods but is also enmeshed in practices and sites that administer and govern sociological knowledge, such as journals and curricula. Additionally, Eurocentric frames are organically connected with the discipline of anthropology with which sociology was interfaced through coloniality. It then discusses the other three methodological constituents that help to frame global sociology: provincialization, methodological nationalism and endogeneity. It concludes by suggesting that global sociology is possible if we work with these methodological constituents at many levels.",sociology

Physical education and sociology in North America have had numerous mutual ties since the beginnings of both fields. In the first section of the paper, I describe the rise of sociology and physical education in North America, emphasizing the linkages that initially existed between physical education and sociology, and then the separation that transpired between the disciplines. The second section examines the connections between social theory and physical education before the sociology of sport was formally developed. The final section details the rise of sociology of sport, with the main focus on the role of physical educators (a.k.a. sociocultural kinesiologists, sport studies scholars, human kinetics scholars) in the development of sociology of sport. This section concludes with a discussion of the linkages of social theory, critical pedagogy in physical education, and sport sociology in physical education.",sociology

Yet, the Bourdieusian roots of field analysis pose challenges as well as advantages, given the widespread critique of reductionist elements in Bourdieu’s thinking. This introduction to the special issue lays out how Bourdieu conceives of field analysis and some of the ambivalences this might give rise to. The papers in this special issue explore through worked examples how field analysis might be radicalized and made more dynamic. We focus on three main issues: (1) understanding emerging field dynamics which challenge the influential model that Bourdieu uses in Distinction, (2) showing the potential for comparative analysis and (3) recognizing the role of materiality in cultural relations. The papers collected here allow for varied engagements with the theoretical underpinnings of the classical formulations of field theory, via empirical analyses of both ‘established’ and ‘new’ fields to explore the trajectories of possible developments in field analysis.",sociology

We make the argument for sociologies of race that go beyond surface level reconstructions, and which challenge sociologists to reflect on how their discipline is presently configured. What the suite of papers in this collection shows is both the resilience of race as a construct for organising social relations and the slippery fashion in which ideas of race have shifted, transmuted and pluralised. It is in a spirit of recognising continuity and change that we present this collection. Some of the papers already stand as landmark essays, while others exemplify key moments in the broader teleology of race studies. This includes articles that explore the ontological ground upon which ideas of race, citizenship and black identity have been fostered and the need to develop a global sociology that is critically reflexive of its western orientation. The theme of continuity and change can be seen in papers that showcase intersectional approaches to race, where gender, nationality, generation and class offer nuanced readings of everyday life, alongside the persistence of institutional forms of discrimination. As this work demonstrates, middle-class forms of whiteness often go ‘hiding in the light’ yet can be made visible if we consider how parental school choice, or selecting where to live are also recognised as racially informed decisions. The range and complexity of these debates not only reflect the vitality of race in the contemporary period but lead us to ask not so much if race ends here, but where?",sociology

Drawing on Max Weber and Martin Buber, I argue that a vocation only exists when there is a shift in the space, time and ontology of ordinary purposive life. When manifesting a vocation, the sociologist is not an acting subject but part of an unfolding presence. Understood vocationally, then, sociology should not be taught as an object with which students are to identify; it must be taught through ascetic practices that suspend the student sociologist’s subjectivity and allow them to find their potential through their relation with an other that is different but not outside. The emphasis should be not on the student’s comprehension of sociological content but on the ethics of their encounter; the discipline of vocational sociology is not based on the desire of subjectification but on love.",sociology

While emerging adults have low rates of financial literacy overall, this article focuses on college students due to increasing college access and student loan debt. Based on the limited literature that assesses college financial literacy education, it appears that these types of programs may serve to advance college students' financial knowledge. Additional mechanisms that serve to develop college students' financial literacy include parent socialization, banking experience, and high school financial education programs. However, not everyone has the same access to these resources. Thus, given the magnitude of the US student debt crisis and persistent economic inequalities, college financial literacy education may prove beneficial for all students, particularly those from economically vulnerable backgrounds.

It suggested this would be a selfreinforcing process unless there were far-reaching changes in undergraduate curricula which were unlikely to come about. It predicted that the divide between these aspects of British sociology and that practised in North America and many parts of Europe would widen further. British sociology has become somewhat more empirical over the past fifteen years, with the bulk of this expansion in the qualitative area.

Sociology in the USSR benefitted from the weakening of totalitarian control in the 1980s. It became possible to develop and express ideas with relative freedom, i.e., controlled by the state in order to halt the rapid dissolution of the ecological and social fabric. Sociologists were in demand to start empirical research, especially on social crises and public opinion. A somewhat technocratic version of sociology focussing on the economy and social stratification came to be officially tolerated as a major contribution to stabilising the remaining Soviet state policy in the period of perestroika.  With the total collapse of the Soviet empire, however, this imperial sociology has lost its raison d'être. The vacuum left by the demise of the empire, in which a civil society has not yet developed, is parallelled by an intellectual vacuum in post-totalitarian sociology.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0218,"<p>There are many different ways to define work–life balance. Some scholars emphasize that work–life balance requires balancing demands of both paid work and family responsibilities or maximizing satisfaction by minimizing conflict between paid work and family responsibilities. Others view work–life balance as encompassing the way that boundaries blur between work, family, and leisure time. In attempting to address work–life balance, workers are generally trying to preserve both quality of life, and potential for career advancements, while employers are trying to preserve high productivity and reduce worker turnover. Although the term “work–life balance” is widely used, alternative terms are also employed, such as work–family balance, work–life integration, work–life harmonization, or work–life articulation. Research on attempts to manage paid work along with family and other parts of life has been carried out for decades. Yet this scholarship has exploded in the last two decades, particularly as middle-class women have increased their workforce participation, but also work is being carried out during nonstandard hours, technology is creating more permeability between work and home, and union protections have been weakened. Work–life balance efforts may lead to poor-quality jobs in terms of earnings, job security, working time and promotion opportunities, rather than long-term quality employment over the life course that allows for leisure and family time. Research on work–life balance should take structural, rather than individual approaches, to consider workplace cultures, including by occupation and gender inequality, and recognize the different assumptions underlying policies aimed at addressing work–life balance.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0240,"<p>Causal inference is a growing interdisciplinary subfield in statistics, computer science, economics, epidemiology, and the social sciences. In contrast with both traditional quantitative methods and cutting-edge approaches like machine learning, causal inference questions are defined in relation to potential outcomes, or variable values that are counterfactual to the observed world and therefore cannot be answered from joint probabilities alone, even with infinite data. The fact that one can possibly observe at most one potential outcome among those of interest is known as the “fundamental problem of causal inference.” For example, in this framework, the economic return to college education can be defined as a comparison between two potential outcomes: the wages of an individual with a college education versus the wages that the same individual would have received had he or she not attended college. In general, researchers are interested in estimating such effects for certain groups and comparing the effects for different subpopulations. Critical to causal inference is recognizing that, to answer causal questions from observed data, one has to rely on untestable assumptions about how the data were generated. In other words, there is no particular statistical method that would render a conclusion “causal”; the validity of such an interpretation depends on a combination of data, assumptions about the data-generating process based on expert judgment, and estimation techniques. In the last several decades, our understanding of causality has improved enormously, owing to a conceptual apparatus and a mathematical language that enables rigorous conceptualization of causal quantities and formal representation of causal assumptions, while still employing familiar statistical methods. Potential outcomes or the Neyman-Rubin causal model and structural equations encoded as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs, also known as structural causal models) are two common approaches for conceptualizing causal relationships. The symbiosis of both languages offers a powerful framework to address causal questions. This review covers developments in both causal identification (i.e., deciding if a quantity of interest would be recoverable from infinite data, based on our assumptions) and causal effect estimation (i.e., the use of statistical methods to approximate that answer with finite, although potentially big, data). The literature is presented following the type of assumptions and questions frequently encountered in empirical research, ending with a discussion of promising new directions in the field.</p>",sociology

What does it mean to be “non-normative”? Ideally speaking, this connotation structures around a political claiming, a subversive metaphor that does not adhere to the standard gender(ed) expressions. That said, these gender traits challenge the cultural norms, or the dominant languages as historically coined within the medical dictionary. In order to address this, the politics further renders a non-foundationalist approach to gender, as making an attempt to de-objectify any sort of typification of classification. In addition, the diversity and fluidity of it aims to install de-pathologization of identity category, and further, to pacify the rigid gender traits that could potentially make gender more discrete. Thus, its very fluidity establishes an unsettling position of gender and sexual choices, as further to establish anti-imperial, non-hegemonic claim in the US-centric gender positions and theorizations. In lines to this argument, non-normative sexuality studies are an attempt to collate interdisciplinary and non–Euro-American modes of texts, theories, and approaches from the domains of culture, desire, beauty, aging, legalities, medicine, and health, complemented with several dimensions of these disciplines to create a bibliographical space addressing the several bodies, identities, and experiences of these representations. Furthermore, it maps the various changes in the lives, personal experiences, forms of discrimination faced in the past or present, needs, interests, and perspectives of these individuals in varied geopolitics, contexts, and cultures—modeling approaches that might be seen as alternatives to the dominant queer studies.

Although processes of financialisation have meant that extreme indebtedness has been a latent global problem since the 1980s, it was only in the wake of the crash that debt became a manifest systemic issue. This was because it was no longer possible to endlessly defer repayment into the future on the basis of a fantasy of ceaseless growth because it suddenly became clear that the financial system was not good for the debts it had distributed across the globe. Given this crisis, endless finance and repayment projected into the distant future has been transformed into ‘the dead weight of debt’ and led to the emergence of a new class system based upon creditors and debtors. The emergence of this new situation challenges sociologists and policy-makers to think about possible solutions to the socio-economic horror of debt bondage that threatens to destroy the future of not only deeply indebted individuals and their families, but also generations to come who currently stand to inherit a decrepit society that seems hopelessly trapped between a fantasy of endless growth based in financial speculation and a dim recognition of the need for sustainability that finds violent rearticulation in austerity and common sense narratives about the need to balance the books.

Then, especially in the twentieth century, social science developed so as to turn a binary contrast into a triangular one. Sociology had three sources in Western thought: one literary (political philosophy), one quasi-scientific (the philosophy of history), and one scientific (biology).

We argue that this represents a shortcoming that should be addressed by future scholarship. In order to inform future critical gender–environment theorizing, we provide a brief review of ecofeminism and note promising examples of scholarship that takes power and inequality seriously when accounting for phenomena of relevance to women and the environment. It is likely that theorizing at the intersection of gender and the environment will become more prevalent given a growing consensus that social justice and equity are precursors to ecological sustainability; environmental sociologists could be the vanguard of critical gender–environment theory.",sociology

A critical review of recent social and historical studies of sound and technology, attending especially to debates surrounding the theoretical shift from acoustemological or soundscape‐based to signal‐oriented “transductive” approaches, suggests the importance for future STS and Sound Studies work of addressing how shared modes of sensory perception are produced within particular socio‐technical frames.",sociology

Ironically, just when globalisation has been growing in the world, so too have doubts about sociology as an international enterprise. This divergent development between the world and the discipline appears to be the direct result of the demise of positivism. Subsequent theorists have polarised into advocates of `false universalism', e.g. `modernisation theory', `dependency theory' and the post-modernist view of `modernity', all of which assume unitary processes with uniform results - to which international sociology stands opposed. Alternatively they have become celebrants of incommensurable diversity, resting on the assumptions of relativism, which would outlaw international sociology altogether. Instead of endorsing either unity or diversity, the task of international sociology is to specify how global mechanisms combine with regional circumstances, in non-uniform fashion, to shape new trajectories and novel configurations.

By examining notions of body masks, body regimes and body options, which are well established in sociological thinking about the body, this article seeks to prompt consideration of how to utilise theories of the body to examine human–nonhuman animal entanglements in order to establish a multi-species sociology of the body.",sociology

Yet sociological theorists have barely scratched the surface of what philosophers who specialize in Dewey’s work such as Thomas Alexander and Richard Shusterman see as central to his thought, namely, his aesthetics. While in recent years some have drawn attention to Dewey’s aesthetics, this area of his work remains little known within sociology. Even less known is the extent to which Dewey’s aesthetics bears significant resemblances to the thought of Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914). I offer an exegesis of Dewey’s aesthetics, underscoring the roles of quality, emotion, and continuity in it and in Peircean thought alike. Understanding Dewey’s aesthetics in a Peircean key, I argue, calls for shifting theoretical attention from how people “problem solve” to get what they want or engage in “creative action” to transcend their situational constraints, to when, why, and how people, including sociologists ourselves, might engage problematic situations as mediums for transformation, as aesthetic experiences in potential.

For the most part, however, dominant historiographies have been silent on that segregation and, at best, reproduce it when addressing the US sociological tradition. This is evident in the rarity with which scholars such as WEB Du Bois, E Franklin Frazier, Oliver Cromwell Cox, or other ‘African American Pioneers of Sociology’, as Saint-Arnaud calls them, are presented as core sociological voices within histories of the discipline. This article addresses the absence of African American sociologists from the US sociological canon and, further, discusses the implications of this absence for our understanding of core sociological concepts. With regard to the latter, the article focuses in particular on the debates around equality and emancipation and discusses the ways in which our understanding of these concepts could be extended by taking into account the work of African American sociologists and their different interpretations of core themes.",sociology

As a revolutionary epistemology, decolonial theory and methods feature critical insights into knowledges from subaltern voices concerned with how the implementation of modern technologies shape colonial structures, inequalities, the daily lives of the colonized, and resistance strategies. However, decolonial studies have long been the purview of the humanities and remain marginal to the social sciences due, partially, to a dearth of foundational theorizing. Challenging scientific colonialism, historicism, and Eurocentric conceptions of civilization while simultaneously linking these phenomena to racialized exploitation of labor within a modern global capitalist system and resistance to it, W. E. B. Du Bois's sociological theories, methods, and advocacy offer insightful ways to begin decolonizing the discipline, theoretically and in practice, in scholarship and in the world.

Focused on addressing the theoretical convergence between organizational and collective action sociologies, as identified by Friedberg, the paper reinterprets his concept of organized collective action through the critical realist collective subjectivities theory, as proposed by Vandenberghe. The objective is to generate an original Critical Realist Model for Organizational Sociology. This initiative stems from critical realism’s critique of flat ontologies and epistemologies that tend to conflate different objects of reality. The proposed model takes the form of a trialectic generative sequence, highlighting driven objects configured in a specific ontological situation as the necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the emergence of organizations. This sequence includes (a) time-space co-presence and the embodiment process; (b) symbolic community sharing and the identification process; and (c) power dynamics and the processes of representation, delegation, and subordination. This model positions collective organized action as a fundamental intermediary concept for understanding organizations and collective action within a realistic social theory.

It is assumed that sociology provides a better background for analysing and understanding economic institutions than economics itself. This is certainly true, but has led economic sociologists to treat economic theory as the ‘other’ of economic sociology. Thereby, the disciplinary boundary between economics and sociology is reproduced where economic sociology is understood the application of the ‘sociology tradition’ to economic phenomena. This article suggests a change of perspective: economic sociologists should treat economics as an endogenous part of its enquiries, but not to examine what economic theory is, but what it does, i.e. how economic theory shapes the economy. This requires introducing the study of language, concepts and semantic distinctions as an inherent part of economic sociology and its focus on the ‘social’ construction of economic institutions. Ultimately, this suggestion reorients our focus away from ‘authors’ to ‘concepts’. In other words, if economic sociology wants to take the ‘sociological’ and linguistic turn in social theory with its focus on language seriously, it needs to redefine its boundaries.",sociology

We review the insights of these three pioneering sociologists and then discuss ideas about organizations proposed by other scholars, from both management and sociology, from 1910 to the mid‐1970s. Marx, Weber, and Durkheim's theoretical frameworks were tools for understanding the transition to modernity. Marx and Weber saw organizations as sites of class struggle and rationalization, respectively, while Durkheim focused on social cohesion and collective sensemaking, both of which underpin organizations. Later theorists focused more closely on the meso‐level and micro‐level processes that happen within and between organizations. These later theorists emphasized pragmatic concerns of optimizing organizational efficiency and labor productivity (scientific management and human relations theories), processes of affiliation and hierarchy (Simmel), limits to rational decision‐making (the Carnegie School), and environmental conditions that shape organizational processes and outcomes (contingency theories).

Social control and cohesion, differentiation and inequality, collective action, power and influence, and identity formation are just a few of the topics considered by sociologists studying occupations and professions. Four strands of literature compose the sociology of occupations and professions, broadly defined. One strand tackles the division of labor, with the goal of understanding how positions in the division of labor are differentiated from one another (e.g., professions from other occupations), and how those differences are maintained. A second examines occupational communities, and, in particular, the relationship between occupational membership and individual behavior. A third strand focuses on the social activity of work itself, including the labor process, employer control of work, alienation and job satisfaction, unionization and its recent discontents, and the rise and fall of skills. Another thread of scholarship considers how occupations become associated with rewards (e.g., pay, prestige, authority, etc.). The field of occupations and professions has diversified methodologically in recent years, opening up new modes of inquiry into some of these topics. Indeed, whereas case studies of particular occupations dominated the field in the latter half of the 20th century, major empirical research in the last decade have included ethnographies, comparative case studies, network analyses, and quantitative analyses of survey data. And, although the pace of theoretical innovation in the “professions” literature may have slowed in recent years, the field remains a vibrant arena for studies of globalization, technological change, corporate reorganization and changes in employment practices, and the emergence of “new” types of work (e.g., service work, emotional labor).</p>",sociology

The gender pay gap can refer to differences in mean or median annual earnings, weekly earnings, or hourly wage. Because women tend to work part-time at higher rates than do men, and because part-time work tends to pay lower hourly wages relative to full-time work, the size of the gender pay gap is affected by whether full- and part-time, full-year or seasonal, and very young and very old workers are included in the estimates. Among full-time, year-round American workers aged sixteen and above in 2017, the gender pay gap (median weekly earnings) was 18.2 percent, meaning that women earned 81.8 cents of every man’s dollar. In the United States, women of color earn less relative to white men than white women do, owing to racial gaps in pay among women; moreover, within-race gender pay gaps are often smaller among racial/ethnic minorities, reflecting the low earnings of minority men. The gender gap has narrowed considerably since the early 20th century, yet disparities in women’s and men’s earnings persist. Moreover, this narrowing has not proceeded in a linear fashion and the gap has occasionally increased. This entry first introduces important literatures on historic and contemporary trends in the gender pay gap and then discusses the various explanations for the persistence of, and changes in, the gap. These explanations highlight the role of occupational gender segregation; the devaluation of female-typed work; gender differences in experience; family structure, care responsibilities, and the gendered impact of parenthood; workplace structures of inequality; glass ceilings and glass escalators.

The five epistemic strategies range along a spectrum from methodological individualism at one end to holism at the other. Between these two poles, considerations of the social relativity of scientific knowledge arise. Constructionist theories highlight the performative dilemma entailed when science reveals itself to be one narrative among others. Hierarchical theories such as Marxism suggest that public sociology is torn by the irreconcilable contradiction between hegemony and counter-hegemony. Heterarchical theories address both of these two problems together. Heterarchy suggests that science’s claim to universality may interfere with public sociology’s social-transformative aspirations.

It has been argued that approaching humor and satire in politics through a structural hermeneutic method of the Strong Program will enable us to recognize and treat political humor and satire as autonomous and complex cultural systems which carry an internal power to move people.",sociology
10.1177/0038038582016002004,"The paper explores some of the main strands in the development of the sociology of leisure. The nineteenth century founding fathers, with their synoptic theoretical approaches, found space for leisure, although not labelled as such, as an integral part of their work. Veblen introduced the concept of leisure into sociology, but was himself committed to values of efficiency from which standpoint he criticized the drone-like character of the leisure class. His views were more consonant with industrial sociology which emerged as a strong well-funded sub-discipline dedicated to humanize the labour process while also maximizing productivity. It was from among industrial sociologists seeking a fuller explanation of work-place behaviour by looking beyond the factory that a sociology of leisure was developed. It emerged as a satellite to the sociology of work. The sociology of leisure was dominated, in the post-Second World War period, on the one hand by post-industrialism, and on the other hand by data collection, often on a psychologistic and individualistic basis. The reaction has been to return to more synoptic approaches, often combining elements of marxism, culturalism, history and literary criticism. These approaches have also redressed the balance against the notion that leisure is always a symbol of freedom and progress by re-introducing notions of constraint and social control. In conclusion, it is pointed out that leisure, deriving from the latin `licere', properly incorporates both of these meanings, and therefore raises in another form a fundamental problem of sociology itself. The problem concerns the balance between the individual and the social and between freedom and constraint. In this sense, leisure should be treated as an important and integral part of sociology, and not peripheral.",sociology

Both these issues (and the first in particular) are discussed in this interview, together with other more specific and specialized topics, mostly linked to Peterson's equally influential work as a sociologist of music.

The article explores a number of respects in which Musil’s writing can be seen as ironizing our frequent perception of modernity as dominated by the evils of alienation, anonymity, fragmentation and occupational specialization, by exposing the extent to which this perception expresses elements of naïvety and complacency inherent in classical European humanistic discourses centring on values of Bildung and the ‘many-sided personality’.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0066,"<p>World-systems analysis (WSA) emerged in the stormy period between worldwide waves of protest in 1968 and the onset of transformative global economic crisis in 1973. Its founders Immanuel Wallerstein and Terence Hopkins, young sociologists of contemporary Africa in New York’s elite Columbia University, studied and worked with major social theorists of the previous generation: Karl Polanyi, Margaret Mead, C. Wright Mills, Daniel Bell, Seymour Martin Lipset, and Paul Lazarsfeld. WSA attacked modernization theory, the reigning political and intellectual orthodoxy of the era, which had predicted and prescribed the progression of all poorer countries and peoples toward the values and institutions of liberal capitalism, American style. Wallerstein and Hopkins argued that poorer countries and peoples were no less “modern” than wealthier ones. They became poor and dominated as a result of the same process of global formation, beginning with the 16th-century “discoveries,” through which selected Western countries obtained their wealth, advanced capabilities, and colonial empires. Undoing the benign assumptions of modernization as universally beneficial progress, WSA pointed to European imperialism as the main source of underdevelopment. Perceived backwardness derives not from old and stagnant local traditions, but rather from the axial division of labor between world zones unequal in wealth, status, and power: core, periphery, and semiperiphery in between. Expanding income, advanced skills, and citizenship rights in the core were historically supported by various forms of slavery and cheap labor across peripheral areas. WSA thus took neo-Marxian theories of capitalism, including arguments about its future demise, to the global plane. The hallmark of WSA is in shifting the principal unit of analysis from separately studied and case-independent “national” countries to the whole world analyzed as a single system containing various regions, markets, and states. WSA focused on globality long before globalization became fashionable. The radical “unthinking” of capitalist logic and “common sense” is the main claim of WSA. After a brief period of great popularity in the late 1970s, WSA was sidelined mainly for political reasons. The global financial upheaval of 2008, however, brought renewed interest in WSA. Its leading scholars, particularly Giovanni Arrighi and his collaborators, had anticipated this crisis by examining earlier instances of economic and geopolitical turbulence arising from world capitalist consolidations and transitional phases of systemic chaos. Other scholars also advanced WSA theories regarding ancient and medieval world-systems; environmental and economic geography; global cities; modern literature in the space of world creativity; the formation and undoing of labor markets; antisystemic movements; the specific mechanisms of capitalist operations such as commodity chains, race, and ethnic conflicts; the collapse of the Soviet empire and its outcomes; and the rise of East Asian industrialism. Moreover, the epistemology of knowledge became a special line of argument pointing to the blinders and institutional barriers that WSA seeks to overcome. In the early 21st century, world-systems analysis extends intellectual alliances in several directions, particularly with historical and political sociology, heterodox economics, and the political economy of culture.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0247,"<p>Pioneering work on the relationship between race and sexuality can be dated from the late 1970s. Early academic, political, and artistic work by women of color in particular gave voice to women’s simultaneous experiences of heterosexism, racism, sexism, and so on. Queer of color work broadly theorized the role of race and racism in knowledge, politics, and concepts of sexualities. Historical work on empire, slavery, and colonialism further demonstrated this fact, while contemporarily focused transnational work does the same for early-21st-century processes. Given the importance of intersectional and transnational analysis, research on race and sexuality has become a growing and central feature of sexuality studies. Such research does not treat “whiteness” as a taken-for-granted category of analysis, but instead unpacks how sex, sexuality, and race are always co-constituted. With emerging theoretical lenses such as Queer of Color Critique, the study of racialized sexualities has become crucial to any exploration of sexuality. In addition, studies of race and sexuality look at how they have historically informed and continue to inform one another, in ways that include thinking about empire, Racisms, carcerality, surveillance, criminology, deviance, desire, and changing understanding of the erotic. Both intersectional and transnational work consider multiple racial formations and take into account the multiple genealogies of sexuality studies, centralizing work that is informed by women of color feminisms, transnational feminisms, queer theory, and black feminist thought. To best understand racial and sexual formations, race and sexuality studies allow us to think of the two as always informing one another. Thus it shifts our attention from primarily thinking about stable identity categories and culture to centralizing people’s relations to power.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0264,"<p>The subject of urban crime has long fascinated researchers, policymakers, social workers, journalists, and the public. Historically, the subject of crime has been so linked to urban places that the very mention of cities has evoked images of violent slums and fear of victimization. It is common for government officials to publicly politicize and racialize urban crime as they pander to certain blocks of voters. For instance, among his many derogatory comments about cities and urban populations, former US President Donald Trump—a New Yorker—tweeted about needing help with “crime-infested inner-cities.” Why the emphasis on crime in cities? A main reason is that crime is not randomly distributed. Rather, environmental opportunities for crime vary by time and place, and cities tend to have characteristics that increase vulnerability to crime. Though cities vary along many dimensions, including culture, climate, history, politics, and demographic characteristics (e.g., population size, density, racial and ethnic heterogeneity, age structure, and migration patterns), crime rates historically have been higher in urban communities than in rural, suburban, and smaller-sized places, on average. For this reason, many consider cities to be the ideal social laboratory for studying crime. Urban sociology has been essential to the theory and research on crime as a place-based social problem. Research on the spatial distribution of crime has compared different levels and scales of analysis, including samples of cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and neighborhoods (as defined by residents, researchers, or administrative census boundaries). Many studies focus on a single city, or even a single neighborhood. In addition, the urban crime literature covers topics that are quite varied, including different place-based theoretical approaches, concepts, explanations of causes and consequences, and policies. For example, researchers have explored topics related to the impact of neighborhood residential mobility on crime, the consequences of residents’ experiences with crime on their sense of neighborhood attachment, and the ways in which crime control policies affect the distribution of crime and residents’ lives. The books and articles outlined below are not exhaustive, but instead we view them as a curated sampling of the vast range of research on these topics—simply one of many ways to organize the vast amount of work that has accumulated on the important but broad subject of cities and crime. We respectfully acknowledge that this summary is focused on the United States and that many subtopics relevant to urban crime necessarily have been omitted because of space constraints but deserve their own bibliographies to be drafted by experts in those subfields.</p>",sociology

This article begins with this ascending significance of the person in the neoliberal world of work, where the personal accumulation of skills and devolution of responsibility to individuals are privileged. Theoretical approaches to personhood attempt to respond to these changed conditions, with the work of Pierre Bourdieu often thought incapable of properly explaining such contemporary phenomena. In response, this article approaches personhood through the frame of Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic capital, those properties ‘misrecognized’ as belonging to the person when they are in fact the product of relations in which the person is enmeshed. A reconstruction of the concept in the sociologist’s work, along with analyses of its implications for a philosophy of perception and for ideology, will show the way for an unexpected approach both to Bourdieu’s own work, reframed through the concept of symbolic capital, and to personhood, which is revealed to be a profoundly and paradoxically relational notion.",sociology

By tracing these processes and embedding “corrupt” practices in the situations where they were developed and make sense, we gain a deeper understanding of these practices and are in a better position to evaluate them. We are also able to make better comparisons, comparing objects shaped by similar processes rather than objects identified by definition alone. We proceed, first, by situating our intervention in the context of the rise of a disembedded approach to corruption.

The popularity of these unscripted programs merits investigation. Reality shows can be seen as significant cultural objects whose production and consumption reflect and reveal norms and ideologies of contemporary culture. Although what is currently conceived as the reality television genre is perceived as novel, this type of programming has a long history, with its foundations dating back to the early days of television. Despite the popularity of reality television and its solid roots in Western media, sociology has been underused in its analysis. In this essay, I review the research on reality television. Its definition, history, and issues of classification in the genre are addressed. Then, I summarize the major themes in the research: production; analysis of content, presentations of race, gender, and sexuality; and audience response and interaction. I conclude with a discussion of what sociology might add to the existing research.What are sociologists to make of the current wave of reality television? What do these shows and their popularity tell us about society? Despite the editing and packaging of these shows and the way people are turned into television‐friendly characters and prototypes, these programs bear similarities to social research. Many are explicitly or implicitly promoted as ‘social experiments’. Reality shows often cast relatively diverse groups with the intention of seeing whether conflict or harmony will result. Success in reality competitions is often achieved through the development of alliances and strategic relationships and the process by which these unions form can be sociologically fascinating to watch. Yet, sociology, in method and theory, has rarely been applied to the analysis of reality television. This is not to say that reality television has not been examined academically. In fact, there is a growing body of research, primarily conducted by communication studies scholars, that takes this type of television seriously.Research on reality television examines the production and reception of programs. Additionally, there are studies that document the significance of the popularity of this genre in television and popular culture. Other research analyzes the content of reality television, aiming to make sense of communication norms depicted on shows like <jats:italic>Survivor</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Big Brother</jats:italic>. Although many of the articles and books about reality television investigate themes with which sociologists are quite familiar (e.g., identity, stereotypes, social structure), missing from most of the current analyses is systematic use of rigorous sociological methodology, perspective, and theory. Sociology could contribute a great deal to the study of reality television. Certainly, a microsociological, symbolic interactionist analysis of both the content of reality shows and the ways viewers interact with them would be a useful extension to the existing literature. Sociologists have done rich ethnographic research in the study of talk shows (e.g., <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b1"">Abt and Mustazza 1997</jats:ext-link>; <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b30"">Gamson 1998</jats:ext-link>; <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b35"">Grindstaff 2002</jats:ext-link>), and it would be beneficial to have an in‐depth, inside look at the production of reality television, particularly given that its reality is contested. Additionally, sociologists could provide important perspective regarding how reality programming reflects, challenges, and perpetuates existing inequalities, particularly with respect to race, class, gender, and sexuality. A critical understanding of the impact of social structure on popular culture, from a sociological point of view, would add another dimension to the study of reality television, continuing the strong tradition in research on culture that demonstrates how cultural objects have much to tell about social life, values, and ideologies.Sociology has been used to make critical contributions to the study of television. As <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b34"">Grindstaff and Turow (2006</jats:ext-link>) note, sociologists have been instrumental in documenting the significance of television as an industry and important part of the economy, and as a primary medium of distribution of mass cultural products. television has unified generations of Americans, creating media events and spectacles, shaping and reflecting changing norms and conceptions of reality (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b22"">Dayan and Katz 1994</jats:ext-link>).

The seemingly impossible has happened: borders have closed, nations have locked down, and individuals have socially isolated for the collective good. We find ourselves involved in an unprecedented social experiment. This living laboratory is ripe for sociological analysis. In this introductory article, we provide a broad sociology of Covid-19, paying attention to the production of pandemics and the creation of vulnerabilities. We acknowledge the dystopian elements of the pandemic: it will provide opportunities for ‘disaster capitalists’ to profit, it will enhance certain forms of surveillance, and it will impact some constituencies far more negatively than others (here we pay particular attention to the pandemic’s gendered consequences). Yet there are also resources for hope. We are witnessing altruistic acts the world over, as mutual aid groups form to render assistance where needed. Notions of welfare reform, progressive taxation, nationalisation and universal basic income now seem more politically palatable. Some even predict the imminent demise of neoliberalism. While this may be too hopeful, reactions to the pandemic thus far do at least demonstrate that other ways of living are within our grasp.

In light of this, I highlight the visual dimension of the social construction of reality by analyzing visual perception as a process of ‘socio-mental filtration’. Building on theories of social construction — most notably those using the concepts ‘frame’, ‘paradigm’ and ‘schema’ — in which expectations are the organizing force of experience, I focus on how social construction happens. One key effect of expectations is to enact selective attention, which is evocatively captured by the metaphor of a filter. Drawing on the case of sex and gender, I demonstrate that using filter analysis to identify the specific dynamics of ‘socio-optical construction’ — adding a concrete analysis of visual perception to the general idea of social construction — may help scholars to more effectively account for some of the ‘hard problems’ of constructionist theory, such as the body.",sociology

Educational curriculum plays a central role in settler colonialism by denying both long-standing connections to the land and dehumanizing those on it, relegating them to objects to be controlled or assimilated by colonizers, positioned as the colonized land’s rightful owners. This has long been the case for Palestinians. Violent expulsion from their land began with the settler colonial Zionist project in the late-19th century, a time of global colonization, and continues into the present, alongside the denial of Palestinian subjectivity and ‘permission to narrate’ their own history in public, political, and academic discourses.

First, I show how feminist animal studies as a theoretical perspective engages with issues that are core to feminist and queer sociology.

This paper summarises three versions of the sociology of psychiatry (social causationism, interpretive micro-sociology and structuralism). These are then contrasted with the more recent post-structuralist emphasis on deconstruction. The latter has emphasised a discursive shift in psychiatry since Victorian times, from brain to mind, from coercion to voluntarism, and from hospital to community. The advantages and disadvantages of such an analysis are examined. It is concluded that this analysis has been illuminating but that the older approaches it challenges still have merits. The implications of attempting to reconcile these approaches to the analysis of contemporary psychiatry are discussed.",sociology

Bourdieu’s reflexive sociology hopes to undo these crippling effects by making the scholar aware of the limits of his/her ‘liberation’. Through his emphasis on the practical content of social life, Bourdieu provides a powerful alternative to theoretical critiques of contemporary society advanced by sociologists such as Adorno. At the same time, read against the background of Adorno’s ‘critical theory’, this reflexive move itself appears as a limitation. Due to its emphasis on the conditions of sociological knowledge, reflexive sociology tends to subordinate ‘theory’ to ‘epistemology’ and, therefore, hinders the sociologist from imagining a different society. Read together, Bourdieu’s and Adorno’s works provide important insights about two potential dangers that remain on the path of the sociologist. Adorno’s critique of ‘scientism’ implies that adhering to an epistemological principle may not be enough to escape the ‘ fallacious’ representations of social reality, while Bourdieu’s critique of ‘theoreticism’ implies that one cannot grasp social reality without ‘touching’ it.",sociology

This article considers these developments and discusses the significance that recognizing the central place of care in social life might have for sociology. To understand what contemporary sociology might offer the study of care, in turn, I draw on the work of a number of leading contemporary theorists to identify four themes that have particular significance for the study of care: the body; individualization; risk; and the new organizational logics. The potential application of these four themes to the study of care is identified and a number of contemporary developments and future options considered.",sociology

This article argues that novel writing presents sociologists with a process and medium through which they can expand their work for a more public, engaging, affective, and panoramic sociology. Here, the historical development of sociological thought is considered as well as the recent progress of public sociology. Three key strengths of sociological novels are presented: promoting public sociology and interlocutor engagement; transforming knowledge exchange from mimetic to sympractic communication; and addressing issues of scope. Two recent sociological novels are discussed: Blue by Patricia Leavy and On The Cusp by David Buckingham, both published in 2015. Finally, two linked aspects for (thinking about) writing sociological fiction are explored: the concept of glocality and the methodology of ethnography. Employing creative mediums such as novels as public sociology may cultivate a wider, affective public engagement with significant academic ideas such as the sociological imagination.

In this article, based on a relational conceptualization of value, the author calls for a value turn that could open childhood theorization both to new forms of cultural analysis of social processes at the familial, national, and global scales, and to new forms of applied research on policy fronts such as childcare and education policies, civil society engagement, and parenting.

Analysing these two concepts in terms of both their merits and applicability, the present article indeed identifies a conflict between them, highlighted by what emerges as Mills’ own failure to realize this vision. After deeming these directives worthy goals, the article seeks to determine whether technological advances in the social sciences have the potential to allow both directives to be fulfilled at once.

Central to the views expressed in this article is the subject’s relation to self as a bifurcated process, one that has broken with the reassurances of state and society.

These developments, it is argued here, actually created the form of the social that became large-scale modern western society. This new form of the social was and remains distinct from those older forms that were seen to flow from the natural sociality of human beings. Between the middle of the 16th century and the end of the 17th the new form of the social emerged in different parts of Europe, contingently but not entirely accidentally, as a separate domain of relatively safe and free human interaction. It was a consequence — in part intended, in part unintended — of different bids to secure civil peace in times of extreme inter-communal, inter-confessional violence. These bids included, to name just three measures: the development of new forms of public law, especially in Germany; the development of the absolutist state, especially in France; and the separation of private religious conscience from public legal conscience, especially in England.

While this institutionalization is recognized to have been advanced primarily by Arthur Ruppin, there is growing agreement among historians that several authors working more or less parallel to Ruppin greatly contributed to the emergence of the field in Italy, Russia, Great Britain, and Germany and to the emergence of a vast body of research in German, Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew. Although the boundaries between European sociological discourses (e.g., Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss in France or Georg Simmel in Germany) and Jewish sociology are not always stable, scholars widely assent that European Jewish sociology denotes the study of contemporary Jewry with the tools of modern social science. Historians have also documented the unstable boundaries between European and American Jewish sociology (e.g., Max Weinreich, Maurice Fishberg, or Joseph Jacobs). Scholars also agree that similarly to broader trends in Europe connected to the emergence of nationalism, its general context was that of attempts to employ scientific tools for the rationalization of society, and more specifically for finding solutions to social tensions and problems. As such, its generators viewed its primary aim to study and understand the condition and future tendencies of Jews in modern non-Jewish-majority societies. In particular, this included degrees of assimilation of Jews into non-Jewish societies and the measurement of anti-Semitic hostility toward Jews. In comparison with other branches of sociology, Jewish sociology tended to focus on empirical questions and showed less interest in general theoretical or methodological concerns. With Ruppin’s immigration to Palestine in 1908 and his position as a professor of sociology (1926–1943) at the newly established Hebrew University, the center of European Jewish sociology shifted to Palestine. Studies in the field were continued by some of Ruppin’s prominent former students.</p>",sociology

On the other hand, it offers a critical discussion seeking to identify aspects of power and politics in their formation and employment. The goal is to demonstrate the relevance of Durkheim’s late work in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life for global analysis as well as to point to some limitations in the way it has been employed by contemporary cultural sociologists. A core limitation is a tendency to balance theorization away from issues of power and politics. Three themes of power and politics of/in global injustice symbols are treated: (1) the way symbolic processes involve amnesia and idolization; (2) how they revolve around meaning adaptation and self-celebration on the part of symbolizing agents; and (3) their implication in de-symbolizing and re-symbolizing activities.

Recent years have, however, witnessed no little debate amongst music sociologists about the broader purchase and value of such scholarship, especially considering its apparent challenge to Bourdieu’s critical cultural sociology. This article seeks to contribute to debates in this area by advocating a novel approach to questions about music’s relation to the social, one that seeks less to map the social distribution of taste profiles or explore how listeners make use of music’s affordances than understand the variable ways in which music emerges as something to be attended to (or not) in the first place. Drawing on recent work in relational sociology, the mature philosophy of pragmatist John Dewey as well as new materialist thought, this article explores the potential of a trans-actional prospectus for music sociology. This is an approach that advocates a ‘flat’ social ontology in order to focus on questions about the constitution and configuration of musical events. In so doing, the article argues that if we are to gain a better understanding of music’s varied relation to the social, it is necessary to transcend the residual substantialism implicit in ‘new sociology’ and mediation-focused accounts and adopt an approach capable of integrating concerns of object-ness, emergence and attention with questions of power and inequality.",sociology

This paper takes up the debate about the mechanisms of containment with reference to a neglected aspect—the process of ideology production itself. It is suggested that the symbolic structure of radical ideologies may be understood as the outcome of three conceptual processes: (1) de-legitimation; (2) dis-alienation; (3) `commutation' or communication/interaction. The ideological product may also be evaluated, in sociological terms, as a theoretical and empirical response to determinate social problems. Two recent examples are used to illustrate the main lines of such an analysis: the International Marxist Group in Britain, and Students for a Democratic Society in the USA. They indicate that the internal, conceptual requirements of a radical ideology, and especially the need to publicly present and validate ideological knowledge, may distort the social analysis in ways which render it less effective as a force for political mobilization, and therefore magnify the effects of more familiar structural constraints on radical movements.",sociology

What such an understanding fails to take into consideration, however, are the connections between Europe and the rest of the world that constitute the broader context for the emergence of what is understood to be the modern world and its institutions, such as the state and market.

The expansion of childhood sociology, however, has been slow, and the political impulse which supported children’s participation has partially evaporated. Childhood sociology in Italy remains marginal in scientific research and university teaching. Its future depends partly on renewed political commitment to promoting children’s participation; however, its main obstacle is the lukewarm interest within the sociological community.",sociology

The introduction of this e-special discusses the increasing importance of gender in sociological analysis in the 1980s. This development is related to a shift from production to consumption and a growing interest in life-style leading to the debates around ‘the end of class’, the ‘cultural turn’ and ‘identity politics’. We assess the influence of articles published in the 1980s and how sociology – both the discipline and the journal – have changed since these articles have been published. The selected articles provide a historical perspective and are – as we argue – still highly relevant for the current state of the discipline and sociological debate. They illustrate the evolution of British sociology, from an emphasis on class analysis in the 1970s towards the growing prominence of intersectionality and subjectivity in the 1990s and beyond. Feminist theory and research in the 1980s within and beyond Sociology indicate the importance and utility of intersectionality, even if the terminology has shifted, and the decade resulted in considerable advances in terms of the prominence, legitimacy and sophistication of gender analysis",sociology

I propose to remedy this situation by drawing upon the ideas of GH Mead, namely his neo-Hegelian theory of the subject–object relationship. Mead’s chief insight is that objects such as books are first social and only then physical entities. They have agency not because of their thing-ness, so to speak, but because of their sociality. After reviewing the existing literature on the book, I discuss Mead’s most relevant contributions. In the proposal for a pragmatic sociology of the book that follows, I combine pragmatism’s focus upon the materiality of meaning-production with genealogy’s concern with power and violence. I conclude with an illustration of the approach: the simultaneous decanonization of Tocqueville’s Democracy in America among sociologists today and its canonization in political science.",sociology

This paper explores the possibility of developing a sociological approach to love based upon the assumption that emotions are culturally constructed. Existing sociological and feminist work is suggestive of themes which the paper seeks to develop: the distinction commonly made between being `in love' and love as longer term affection, the mysterious power accorded to the former emotion, the contradictions between these two forms of love and the ways in which the ideology of romance has been associated with women's subordination. As a means of theorising these aspects of love, a conceptualisation of subjectivity as constituted through narrative or discourse is considered. This perspective may enable us to account for the cultural specificity of emotions, but there are questions which it leaves unanswered.",sociology

Two actors participated in the animating discourse of caste and race in the annals of American sociology. Oliver Cromwell Cox took a class position to define caste, unmaking the hierarchies set in social structures. Instead, he advocated for a racialized system to understand the post-slavery capitalist America. Gerald Berreman represented a different camp that found social hierarchies to be co-determinant of relations and division arranged into a caste society. The debate over caste, nevertheless, admitted to the plausibility of castes contrasted with India’s caste system. However, caste categorization was found to be an appropriate application to the conditions of social inequalities. Gunnar Myrdal and other scholars of repute contributed to the debate. What remained limited in their theoretical contributions to the discussion was an inadequate focus on the lived reality and politics of the caste formulations in the postcolonial, socialist mode of production. A serious examination of untouchability, sub-castes and sub-sub-castes that regulate the kernel of the caste system as well as the racialized castes in India were not studied or referenced in detail.

In the present essay a reading of `mainstream' English Puritan writings on the calling is presented, and Weber's representation of the idea is found to be accurate except for an exaggeration of its asceticism, probably due to Weber's reliance on post-Civil War sources. The Puritan themes of chance, proof, and control are then shown to be prominent in Weber's usage of Chancen to define social action and institutions, and fundamental to the method of interpretive sociology. The rationalist biases of Weber's work, the problematic formal-substantive distinction, and Weber's justification of ideal-typical analysis are assessed in terms of the Puritan Berufsmensch who `neither inquires about nor finds it necessary to inquire about the meaning of his actual practice of a vocation within the whole world, the total framework of which is not his responsibility, but his God's'.",sociology

Relying on a diverse literature of recent studies that focus on cities as dense sensory environments, this article shows the significance of studying city life at the experiential and sensory levels. First, a few seminal early works are discussed, with specific emphasis on Georg Simmel. Then, each of the five bodily senses and their correlated sensescapes – seescapes, soundscapes, smellscapes, tastescapes, and touchscapes – are presented in order to show individuals and groups use their senses to experience and make sense of the city.

Such debates around conceptualization naturally led to disagreements over the manner in which authority should be measured (qualitative categories versus quantitative scales) for empirical assessment of social inequality. Thus, this field of sociological inquiry is about measuring positions in the workplace, the processes leading to those positions, and the consequences of those positions for workplace rewards. In addition to theory and measurement, the emergence of authority research includes studies of gender, race, and ethnic differences in the factors that determine authority and in the consequences of authority for various workplace outcomes. As multiracial/ethnic samples became available, researchers focused on the manner in which gender intersected with race/ethnicity to forge differential authority outcomes for men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Studies here underscore the fact that job authority remains unevenly distributed nationally (race/ethnicity, gender), and cross-nationally (gender), and authority gaps have remained robust over time. Authority studies employ a variety of data from the United States and Europe, regions that dominate quantitative assessments of authority inequality, but recent data from Israel and Korea foreshadow the extension of these inquiries to less traditional locales, thereby expanding our understanding of group differences and similarities in authority attainment more globally.</p>",sociology

Additionally, sociological research offers a wealth of empirical evidence concerning how children and youth experience, navigate, reinforce, and/or challenge racial inequality, racism, and racial discrimination in their everyday lives.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0223,"<p>The term “professions” generally refers to occupations that require expertise obtainable only through specialized training and credentialed by advanced degrees or licenses. Examples include academia, medicine, law, engineering, the clergy, and accountancy. The professions generally provide greater social prestige relative to other occupations. Moreover, professionals determine the scope of their work, the requisite level of expertise, and the terms of inclusion. Much of the research on gender and professions highlights the structural barriers to entry and advancement by women. Because the professions developed from endeavors long considered “gentlemanly vocations,” they were historically dominated by men. Most universities prohibited women from matriculating until the mid-1800s, allowing few to obtain the advanced education required for the professions. By excluding women from highly rewarded roles, the professions have long produced and maintained gender inequalities, particularly the Wage Gap. Over recent decades, women have entered the professions in growing numbers. In some cases, such as veterinary medicine, women have even overtaken men numerically, resulting in the feminization of the field. Salaries in feminized professions, or sectors of a profession, are generally lower than are those in fields with fewer women. The explanations offered for this wage gap involve devaluation or queuing. The devaluation view argues that the sex composition of a profession affects the salary offered. Because of gender bias, employers devalue work done by women. Consequently, they lower the rewards in occupations numerically dominated by women. This is particularly the case for professions involving emotional labor and care work. In the queuing view, the salary levels of a profession affect its gender composition. Although both men and women prefer to work in higher paid professions, employers prefer to hire men for high-reward positions. This suggests a gendered labor queue consisting of men, leaving women clustered in professions offering lower pay. In research on other topics, different definitions of “gender” lead to varying perspectives on its implications for the professions. When understood as a set of attributes associated with biological sex, research emphasizes the sex-typing of skills and sex-based differences within professions. When understood as a relation that influences interactions and identities, research investigates how gender informs the daily functioning of the workplace in various ways, producing professional cultures that create formal or informal barriers and advantages.</p>",sociology

This body of scholarship documents both similarity and difference between the health experience of men and women across the life course. Gender-based health patterns are dependent upon the health outcome examined, as life expectancy is shorter among men while women experience higher rates of various non-fatal functional problems and chronic medical conditions. Gender differences also exist in mental health outcomes and participation in various healthy and unhealthy behaviors, including utilization of health care services. Yet these associations are not uniform and can differ when various population subgroups are compared. As such, a growing body of scientific work argues for the need to apply an intersectional lens to the study of gender and health, and this work details how various cross-cutting identities (e.g., age, racial/ethnicity identity, social class, sexual orientation) intersect with gender to shape health outcomes. More recently, scholars have begun to assess how non-binary measures of gender identity relate to health status, and thus a small but increasing body of research explores whether and how health status varies for cisgender and transgender adults. While a substantial amount of attention has been given to describing the nuances of how gender relates to health status, the gender-health literature is also characterized by robust discussion of the factors that contribute to gender patterns in health status, including but not limited to socioeconomic status, relationships and care work, differential experiences in medical care treatment, masculinity, stress and social supports, and health behaviors.

Therefore, she needs a fiduciary to carry out that action, who does not necessarily have an interest in carrying it out to the satisfaction of the beneficiary. Since this is a problematic and potentially dangerous relationship for the beneficiary, both in private law and in democratic political relations, the fiduciary must be held accountable.

Finally discusses are the principles of structural analysis, structuralism in language, literature and culture, in social structure, with regard to society and the individual, religion, philosophy, politics, sociology and social-anthropology.</p>",sociology

It emphasizes the desire to use both sociology and social media platforms to stimulate civic engagement and public participation. It also discusses several propositions, such as the opposition on the professionalization of public sociology through its institutionalization as a sociological subgenre. The chapter talks about the approach to social media platforms as digital commons that enable participation inside and outside, and the recruitment of the figure of 'the public intellectual' that recasts social media as a less elitist and more sociable figure that speaks as much as they listen. It articulates a vision for thinking and doing things differently in ways that empower, instead of powering social media systems or academic institutions whose interests can and often do diverge from people.</p>",sociology
10.1332/policypress/9781529211740.003.0002,"<p>A unifying theme in the chapters in this volume is that semiotics offers important analytic tools for understanding the creation and reproduction of contextual meaning in social life (see Introduction). Consistent with this theme, my research program has centered on the semiotic distinction between the socially marked and the socially unmarked. I have employed these sensitizing analytic concepts to examine a range of issues, including sexual identity (Brekhus, 1996), theoretical attention in sociology (Brekhus, 1998, 2000), cognition (Brekhus, 2015; Brekhus and Ignatow, 2019), risk (Brekhus, 2018), and identity (Brekhus, 2020). Broadly speaking, I focus on identity, difference, cognition, and representation, with a particular interest in the ways that intersecting dimensions of markedness and unmarkedness shape cultural perception, worldviews, cognition, and the reproduction of social inequalities. The semiotic distinction between the marked and the unmarked was first introduced in the 1930s by linguists Trubetzkoy and Jakobson (see Jakobson, 1972; Trubetzkoy and Jakobson, 1975: 162). Linguist Linda Waugh (1982), in her article “Marked and Unmarked: A Choice between Unequals in Semiotic Structure,” developed the marked/unmarked distinction into a broader semiotic framework featuring semiotic pairs such as blackness/whiteness and homosexuality/heterosexuality, across different semiotic systems (see also Zerubavel, 2018, p. 2). Following the lead of Waugh, who argued that the same logic of the actively accented (marked) and the passively unacknowledged (unmarked) that applied to linguistic contrasts also applies to social contrasts, I have helped to import these concepts into the social sciences. In my own work, inspired by Waugh’s analysis, I first applied a semiotic markedness/unmarkedness analysis to sexual identity construction in the US (Brekhus, 1996), wherein I noted that some sexual behaviors and identities are marked as “deviant” and given special labels, while others remain unmarked, unaccented, and even unlabeled.</p>",sociology
10.1177/1468795x03003001694,"While the late 19th-century analytic context in which classical sociology emerged was constituted in substantial part by a discourse of political economy, the subsequent development of the discipline has been characterized by a growing analytic distance between sociology and economics. With increasing specialization in the field of knowledge in the course of the 20th century there was a neglect of social institutions in orthodox economic analysis and a parallel relative neglect of economic phenomena within sociological analysis. The latter condition has been exacerbated by the ‘cultural turn’ in social thought that took place towards the close of the century, ironically a period marked by the growing prominence of economic matters in social and political life. This paper presents an argument for a return to the analytic concern with economic life that lies at the heart of classical sociology, for an ‘economic turn’ in contemporary sociological thought. This is achieved through a discussion of the work of J.K. Galbraith on economics and the transformation of capitalism; private affluence and public provision; and the consequences of a culture of contentment, work that suggests an affinity with the analytic preoccupations of the classical sociologists. The paper demonstrates the sociological relevance of the social and institutional analyses of J.K. Galbraith.",sociology

This article suggests that these insights may be incorporated into the critical sociology of art once we are ready to substitute reified tasting techniques for reified tastes as our main objects of study. Relying on works in anthropology, philosophy, history and neuroscience, I urge us to put tasting techniques at the heart of our research agenda in cultural sociology.

It is in this context that his specific concept of `power' has to be understood (3) and acquires primal relevance as a tool for the reconstruction and explanation of the processual structures of long-term societal developments (4). The second part of the paper (4- 7) interprets Elias's studies of `the civilizing process' in the light of the preceding discussion of his theoretical approach, devoting attention to - among other things - the problem of physical force and its monopolization, and to the analysis of `rationalization' (in Weber's sense).

I argue that these provide mechanisms for deriving measures of change internally to the research process itself, rather than through the external comparison of separate sources as practised by historians.

Emphasizing the metropolis as a social space and promoter of sociological thought, it delves into the lives and works of key figures such as Georg Simmel, Robert E. Park, W.E.B. Du Bois, Frieda Wunderlich and Rose Laub Coser. Their interactions, perspectives and transnational exchanges, particularly between Berlin and other urban centres such as Chicago and New York, are highlighted, illustrating the global interconnectedness of sociological discourse. While acknowledging established sociological icons, the article also highlights the often overlooked contributions of women and scholars of colour, challenging and expanding the traditional understanding of the ‘classical’ in sociological thought. The narrative travels from the early urban sociological and feminist theories that emerged in the metropolis of the 1920s to the complexities of Marxist sociology in a divided Berlin after the Second World War.

Second, the author links the academic success of the category of public sociology to the global division of sociological labour, emphasizing the ‘geopolitics of knowledge’ involved in Burawoy’s work and calling for the decolonization of social science. Then, the author expounds his concerns regarding the hierarchy of the different types of sociology proposed by Burawoy, who privileges professional sociology over other types of sociological praxis. Reflecting upon these elements will provide a good opportunity to observe how our discipline works, advancing also suggestions for its transformation. Along these lines, in the last section of the article the author elaborates on the need to go beyond a dissemination model of public sociology – the unidirectional diffusion of ‘expert knowledge’ to extra-academic audiences – and towards a more collaborative understanding of knowledge production.",sociology
10.1177/0011392112453834,"This article considers the approach to human nature implicit in four textbooks often used to introduce sociology. Human nature is seen as a set of drives and capacities, which play a key role in people’s actions in any social context. In the textbooks, a variety of arguments suggest the irrelevance of a concept of human nature to the discipline. Partly, this message is conveyed by opposing social to biological explanations. In addition, the discipline is framed to exclude the concept of human nature. Society, on the one hand, and the culturally unique individual, on the other, exhaust the sociological arena. Accounts of socialization imply the transcendence of biology and with that, human nature. Refutations of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are supported with broad ranging rejections of biological explanation, with a similar implication that human nature is not a necessary concept in sociological accounts. Nevertheless, human nature is the elephant in the room. The concept is required and assumed in the detail of these textbooks as they explain current sociological research and analysis. One impact of the denial of human nature is to misunderstand current disputes between sociology and evolutionary psychology.",sociology

This perspective was recently taken up in economic sociology by David Stark's introduction of the notion ‘sociology of worth’. The second issue, recently raised by André Orléan, is the attempt to denaturalize economic theory and economic action to demonstrate the social constructed nature of economic action.

Following from recent class debates which apply a Bourdieusian analysis to explore the operations of everyday class distinctions, we explore what such an analysis can offer to the project of critically mapping out the dynamics of this particular reflexivity and ethical consumption. However, FairTrade's emphasis on `just' consumption and invocation of a deserving farmer/worker allows some scope for problematization here too. By turning to an emerging literature on the `moral economy' we reach past the homogenizing tendency in some `new' class analyses to suggest possibilities both for a psychosocial imagining of ethical consumption and for fleshing out the conceptualization of a `situated reflexivity' demanded by recent social theory.",sociology

A review of the journal’s content from that era reveals a surprising dearth of work on the politics of group identity. In contrast, British sociology’s growing interest in questions of self, subjectivity, lifestyle and life course is well represented.

Through sophisticated use of theory, research and case studies many of the articles included in the e-special challenge the simplifications of this thesis. The selected articles are grouped in four sections: the first looks at attempts to theorize self-identity in late modernity; this is followed by three articles on consumerism and lifestyle; the next section contains articles on biography and the life course.

However, the Japanese image of ‘historical sociology’ is not that of a comparative history based on social scientific interests but is a history closer to cultural and social history and the history of ideas with an emphasis on descriptive research. This originates from the high degree of freedom given to the use of sources in the historical study of collective consciousness. Accordingly, it was easy to accept the impact of the linguistic turn. Subsequently, Japanese historical sociology evolved into discourse-historical research, media-historical research, and constructionist-historical research. In recent years, historical research on social issues and quantitative historical sociology have become increasingly popular. Historical sociological research has been differentiated into various separate sub-disciplines so it is difficult to identify a cohesive historical sociology as a field.

Written in the first person, Bridget Fowler’s reflections move between different religious and political worlds, focusing especially on her reception of conflicting sociological theories and her own development through these. Influenced by five exceptionally learned and lucid sociologists – John Rex, Herminio Martins, Raymond Williams, Pierre Bourdieu and Terry Lovell – she has spent her sociological career contributing to the demystification of power in various forms. In particular she has focused on the significance of secular culture – notably literature – in creating hegemonic domination. She has also analysed the role of symbolic revolutions in social transformation, avoiding in this respect falling either into idealism or simplistic class reductionism. Arguing that sociological theory still needs to teach Marx, Weber and Durkheim, these founding figures should not be seen as creating – in social scientific terms – a unified architectural construction, but should be read with and against one another; further, they need also to be combined with other, more contemporary, influences. Finally whilst noting the existential salience of movements around identity – nation, gender, sexuality and disability – she argues that the discipline must continue to reach out ‘beyond the fragments’, to address social totalities more broadly, including wider issues of social space and structures of power.",sociology
10.1177/08969205221085687,"Sociology is one of the major disciplines to foster understanding and protection of the livelihoods of local people. For instance, the discipline can describe the linkage between the environment and people and the effects of environmental change on local groups of people in a Delta country such as Bangladesh. However, the imperial philosophy of modernity that dominates the discipline and which is evident in the Sociology department at the University of Dhaka (UofD) underscores a considerable distance between academic conceptualizations of local perspectives on issues such as climatic change and the actual views of the local people of Bangladesh. Grounded on this assertion, this paper explores a question: What are the challenges for Sociology to represent Delta people and protect their social justice? The paper depends on the content analysis of sociological practices at UofD: imperial modernity and climatic adaptation. The findings of the paper argue that Sociology has been failing to represent the local meanings of climatic change due to the domination of imperial conceptualizations of modernity. Climate finance conceptualized by a Western perspective, and Sociology, as a discipline, fails to represent locally contextualized meanings related to climate finance; thus, the marginalized groups of people are increasingly facing survival challenges responsible for climate apartheid. Only a decolonized Sociology can challenge this imperial domination and play an effective role in reducing the discipline’s gap of understanding of the local people and in promoting social justice in Delta Bangladesh.",sociology

By the end of the century, our attitudes toward animals had changed, and we began to question the subordination implicit in the human–animal boundary.

Drawing on research conducted at an animal shelter, in dog parks, and in interviews and observation, the author argues that animals become such important parts of our lives because of the subjective experience they bring to the relationship. Challenging the view that we simply anthropomorphize animals, Irvine offers a model of animal selfhood that explains what makes relationships with animals possible.

At least two of your sources should come from articles in scholarly journals.Topic 2: Find current media coverage of an event or issue that applies and extends material in the assigned text. This can involve an individual animal, a group of animals, or an entire species. For example, coverage of the role of livestock in global warming could be approached through several of the readings in the course.

If it were ‘natural’ and necessary to consume animals, we would not need advertising campaigns designed to encourage us to do so. The ‘animal industrial complex’ depends on a steady supply of consumers. Vegetarians and vegans are very threatening to the status quo.

10.1177/1440783312458226,"Sociology once debated ‘the social’ and did so with a public readership. Even as late as the Second World War, sociologists commanded a wide public on questions about the nature of society, altruism and the direction of social evolution. As a result of several waves of professionalization, however, these issues have vanished from academic sociology and from the public writings of sociologists. From the 1960s onwards sociologists instead wrote for the public by supporting social movements. Discussion within sociology became constrained both by ‘professional’ expectations and political taboos. Yet the original motivating concerns of sociology and its public, such as the compatibility of socialism and Darwinism, the nature of society, and the process of social evolution, did not cease to be of public interest. With sociologists showing little interest in satisfying the demand, it was met by non-sociologists, with the result that sociology lost both its intellectual public, as distinct from affinity groups, and its claim on these topics.",sociology
10.1111/1468-4446.12077,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>This article introduces the idea of philosophical sociology as an enquiry into the relationships between implicit notions of human nature and explicit conceptualizations of social life within sociology. Philosophical sociology is also an invitation to reflect on the role of the normative in social life by looking at it sociologically and philosophically at the same: <jats:italic>normative</jats:italic> self‐reflection is a fundamental aspect of sociology's <jats:italic>scientific</jats:italic> tasks because key sociological questions are, in the last instance, also philosophical ones. For the normative to emerge, we need to move away from the reductionism of hedonistic, essentialist or cynical conceptions of human nature and be able to grasp the conceptions of the good life, justice, democracy or freedom whose normative contents depend on more or less articulated conceptions of our shared humanity. The idea of philosophical sociology is then sustained on three main pillars and I use them to structure this article: (1) a revalorization of the relationships between sociology and philosophy; (2) a universalistic principle of humanity that works as a major regulative idea of sociological research, and; (3) an argument on the social (immanent) and pre‐social (transcendental) sources of the normative in social life. As invitations to embrace posthuman cyborgs, non‐human actants and material cultures proliferate, philosophical sociology offers the reminder that we still have to understand more fully who are the human beings that populate the social world.",sociology

The idea is to show the reaction to and treatment of Bourdieu’s ideas as a gauge of where we are in the sociology of culture, the various strands of influence that emanate from his work, and to assess what is at stake in a ‘post-Bourdieu’ moment when a position once considered progressive and critical now acts as the foil against which new work is being conducted. The article engages with some recent contributions to the music/society debate from figures in the UK and France, and points to the ways these contributions move debates on musico-social relations into territories more sensitive to the complex mediating qualities of music. Such work is better placed, it is argued, to represent music as an animating force in everyday life, including its specific mediating qualities ‘in action’. At the same time, however, the construction of a new sociology of music is not without its perils. The article will conclude with some potential problems with these approaches, and take stock of what might be lost as well as gained by adherence to them.",sociology

Based on the results of a survey of UK social science academics about the process of applying to National Health Service RECs, we conclude that lessons can be learned for Sociology from the experiences of social researchers in Health. Overly rigid ethics committees could be counter-productive; we may need to reassess the functions of RECs and to strengthen other procedures to ensure the highest ethical standards for Sociology. Some suggestions for how this might be done are taken from the literature in the hope that they will stimulate debate.",sociology

I ask six questions that help us as sociologists to think about how introductory sociology can better serve our discipline, our students, and their communities. These questions ask us to consider who our students are, how the course fits with university mission and program goals, what we want students to learn in this course and how we can build consensus about that common core, the extent to which there is alignment between learning objectives and our disciplinary standards in sociology, how assessment can be used to improve course design and curriculum in general, and the role that introductory sociology plays in recruitment and retention of students to the university and to the major.

During the Middle Ages, when the estates and guild-orders prevailed, there were severe tensions between Christians and Jews. These began to be moderated with the development of capitalism, as members of the Christian middle class became involved in a struggle to end traditional restrictions. In that context, independently of their attitudes towards them, emancipation of the Jews appeared to middle-class Christians as a precondition for the emergence of Jews as good German citizens, and Jewish merchants and bankers became welcome allies in economic expansion. However, once the struggle of the middle classes against the nobility had been won, the Christian sections of the newly dominant ruling class underwent a political u-turn; hostility against the Jews, who had become a middle class of second rank, increased. It increased still further with the loss of the First World War and the crises that followed it, especially among the most economically constricted strata. In that situation, the Jews were socially conspicuous but relatively powerless. They had few resources for struggling effectively against what had become, for them, a crippling social order. Better to fight for a home in Palestine, or at least to accustom themselves to behaving in a self-aware but unobtrusive way. [Translators' text.]",sociology

In this article, I question this, arguing instead for the value of autobiographical writing as part of undergraduate sociology, and pointing to some of the sociological traditions that would support such an approach. Drawing on the experience of inviting sociology students to undertake autobiographical writing for a course on `Gender Inequalities', I examine some aspects of how we may regard such work in sociological terms, in particular, how to regard the truth-claims of autobiographical writing. I suggest that, rather than seeing a dichotomous choice between treating such writing as facts or fictions, we need instead to consider how our subjectivity is itself socially constructed. Society thus can be seen to occur `inside' ourselves. To use ourselves as sources for sociological analysis is a challenging project requiring students to learn to regard their autobiographies in terms of how sociological audiences will receive them.",sociology

The study of race in the social sciences is an established, dynamic, multidisciplinary, and international field. Work began at the end of the 19th century. To study race with a global perspective, it is necessary to have a transdisciplinary view to read critically the phenomena that intersect with this variable. This field includes contributions from sociology, history, philosophy, legal studies, anthropology, cultural studies, political science, epidemiology, and journalism, among others. Several declarations have been made in recent years about the alleged end of racism or the end of a race-coded era. However, even though they are not new, every time they resurge these doxas underline new regimes of truth, reconfigure racisms, and strength inequality. The vast literature produced by scholars in this field provides evidence of how race is based on narratives created to enslave, subordinate, exploit, and exclude millions of human beings across the globe.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0236,"<p>Scholars from various disciplines (anthropology, gender studies, history, philosophy, and sociology, among others) have written about gender and bodies. The interdisciplinary nature of this topic has resulted in scholarship on many different aspects of the body across the life course. The works included here are foundational to knowledge about the gendered body and particularly the sociology of the body. Moreover, they exhibit intersectionality and begin with the assumption that social constructs such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, age, and dis/ability intersect with gender to shape life experiences, social outcomes, and self-concept. While there are many areas that fall under the topic of gender and bodies (such as medicalization, sport, disability, gendered violence, sexual practices, and eating disorders) this article focuses particularly on theory and research on the social construction of female and male bodies, as well as bodies that disrupt sex, gender, and sexuality binaries, i.e., intersex and LGBTQ Bodies. Specifically, there is an abundance of scholarship that examines how social and cultural structures patrol normative femininities and hegemonic masculinities thereby reinforcing binary understandings of sex and gender. Nonetheless, there is some work that emphasizes the undoing of gender, social activism, and embodied resistance. Writings on gendered constructs and the body also examine how some bodies are privileged over others, showing a body hierarchy based on, for example, beauty, skin tone, and body size that furnishes some people with physical capital while disadvantaging others. Finally, the article acknowledges research and theory that engages labor-related processes about the body; the body as a modification project (including body building, tattooing, and Cosmetic Surgery); and the role of medical and other technologies on gendered bodies and lives.</p>",sociology

10.1177/0268580904040920,"In this contribution the relationship between Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of class and semiotics is clarified. It is therefore focused on the relational logic that underpins his analysis in Distinction. It is argued that Bourdieu’s relational logic stems for a large part from Saussure. The differences Bourdieu identifies as signifying classes do so only as arbitrary signs and not because of any intrinsic qualities. Furthermore, it is argued that this relational logic is a necessary completion in Bourdieu’s analysis, because of his rejection of Kantian aesthetics, in which an immediate understanding of intrinsic quality is a central point. Both the Kantian and the Saussurean influence are given in the title and subtitle of his work: Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste. This clarification of Bourdieu’s chief methodological principle shows how Bourdieu, who, in his later years, became more and more engaged in public debates, has always been a critical thinker.",sociology

Secondly I consider his conceptualization of time and history – which in rebutting epochal arguments about the speed of contemporary change allows for a much better appreciation of the ‘long durée’; and finally his conceptualization of social classes and privilege through his elaboration of a sociology of accumulation and inheritance.

Does Europe constitute a meaningful unit from a social scientific point of view at all? The paper argues that this is the case because of its common historical-cultural heritage and because of the increasing density of direct interrelationships between its nations and peoples.  Nevertheless, internal differentiations continue to make of this `continent' one of the most complex and variegated culture areas in the world. Three dimensions are of particular relevance in this regard: (a) the level of socio-economic development; (b) linguistic-cultural and religious traditions; (c) the type of political system. If we allocate 25 of the larger European nation-states to this 3-dimensional typology, we can demonstrate a limited number of relatively internally homogeneous clusters of nations. These are distinguished from each other not only in terms of political system, but also in terms of socio-economic development, language and religion.

Yet Weber remained closer to classic Marxian theory of revolutionary interest groups mobilized from below. He broadened interest groups to include status groups as well as economic classes. His description gives leads for a theory of revolutionary process centered on alliances and splits, bandwagon effects and turning points, and the volatility of revolutionary ideas arising from the social organization of full-time political militants. Weber predicted structural change in Russia leading to bureaucratic dictatorship.",sociology

Within psychology, the condition has been seen as an individual pathology, and there has been little attempt to relate this to the wider cultural context. The argument of this article is that shyness can be interpreted as both a privately felt state of mind and a publicly recognized social role. I revisit Mead’s conception of the self as an inner conversation between the ‘I’ and the ‘Me’, arguing that the shy actor perceives themselves as relatively unskilled in interaction by comparison to a ‘Competent Other’. It is then suggested that it is normal for people to drift into isolated episodes of shyness as primary deviance, but that in some cases the reactions of others can lead to a career of secondary deviance. However, while a display of shyness may be normalized in certain situations, in others it can pose a more serious or enduring threat to the residual rules of interaction.This motivates the non-shy majority to defend their normative assumptions by casting moral blame upon the individual, and reframes the ‘problem’ outside of society.",sociology

The objectivity of this process leading to the complication of society, its dehumanisation and the emergence of new previously unseen risks, is noted. Scientific and technological innovations reduce the share of traditional risks, natural and technological, but increase the share of institutional risks. Sergey A.

Thus, the books hold up a mirror reflecting back onto the discipline of sociology its own implication in European empires and colonization and demonstrate how sociology’s imperial episteme continues to shape the discipline today. This article reviews these books and focuses on how they engage in the double task of the deconstruction of sociology’s complicity in empire and the construction of a colonial critique-centered sociology.

The formation of a ‘global sociology’ demands harmonious development and mutual enrichment between all the four ‘sociologies’, however, each of them has its own path in the global arena. The literature analysis demonstrates serious limitations in the global progression of ‘professional sociology’, while ‘policy sociology’ and ‘critical sociology’ also experience major difficulties. ‘Public sociology’, largely inspired by Burawoy, seems to be especially promising globally due to its key advantages: orientation towards non-academic audiences and a focus on the most acute social problems. However, currently this disciplinary practice has several fundamental constraints: marginality, radicalism, ideological bias and inherent conflict-orientation towards other ‘sociologies’.

Yet ecology specifies that natural and social entities are bound together in complex interrelations. Why then does sociology insist on sifting out the social from the natural? The paper takes this question as its starting point and seeks to identify what environmental sociology might gain and lose from a shift towards ecological thinking. It does so by examining the case of actor-network theory, an approach that, in significant respects, closely approximates a kind of `ecological sociology'. Actor-network theory is `co-constructionist': it seeks to identify how relations and entities come into being together. Critics have focused on the problems of co-constructionism: they have argued that human actors generally possess powers of reflection (through language) and that these powers of reflection provide motive forces for action. Thus some form of social analysis is still necessary. Any ecological sociology will thus need to bring these two perspectives together so that humans and non-humans can be considered within the same frame of reference but so the distinctions that generally hold between the two can also be assessed.",sociology

Educational policies include those official and unofficial guidelines that are developed by policymakers, school administrators, and educators to influence the way that schools both directly and indirectly provide education to students. In the United States, these policies include a variety of state and federal laws and regulations that govern students’ pre-kindergarten, primary (K–8), and secondary schooling (high school), as well as policies affecting higher education (college and beyond). Scholars studying education show that examining how policies are created—who creates it and for what purpose—and also how the policy is put into practice at the state and district level is crucial for understanding inequalities. This entry focuses on K–12 educational policy and race in the United States. More specifically, the focus is primarily on influential policies in schools since the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision, with particular attention on two crucial types of race-based educational policy: desegregation and school choice programs. There are many other educational policies not addressed here that could be examined for their influence in racial schooling inequities. This piece focuses on K–12 educational policies, but policies related to race in pre-K as well as institutions of higher education are also areas in which educational policies are impacted by race relations. Examining those formal and informal guidelines for the way that they shape children’s schooling is crucial for understanding how racial inequalities persist within contemporary society.

In particular, scholars have called for a greater emphasis on incorporating race as a category of analysis within the organizations and movement literatures. Among those studying organizations, one of the earliest calls for this shift came from within the managerial literature. Those heeding this call have primarily investigated race as an individual level characteristic that structures people’s access to and opportunities within organizations. Still, others have sought to analyze how race as a social structural characteristic shapes organizational development and the distribution of resources available to organizations. Similar to organization studies, initially, scholarship on social movements lacked a clear emphasis on race. Although, the irony here is that many scholars derived theoretical innovations within the social movement literature by analyzing movements centering racial justice. Recent scholarship holds that in the absence of clear racial theory, whiteness shapes the discipline to its detriment. Despite the broader concerns about the literature’s state, work within this area consistently emphasizes how people use social movement tactics to advance racial projects from civil rights to white supremacy. Few studies tackle all three themes at once. More often scholars situate their analysis at the intersection of race and organizations or race and movements. At times, scholars situate their investigation squarely within one literature, leaving it to the reader to pull out the themes from the others. The bibliography reflects this reality and tension. There is no singular text or handbook that brings together research on race, organizations, and movements. Yet, the research included within this bibliography deepens our understanding of the role that organizations and movements play in reinforcing and creating racial hierarchy and how racial hierarchy, in turn, shapes these entities.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0216,"<p>Ethnomethodology (literally people’s methodology) is the study of practices through which members of a society collectively organize and sustain their activities. As the term suggests, ethnomethodology treats methodology as a widespread social phenomenon in addition to being a specialized set of practices in a science or other professional undertaking. Consequently, for ethnomethodology, the development and practical use of methods is a topic of sociological investigation rather than an exclusive disciplinary resource. Harold Garfinkel (b. 1917–d. 2011) coined the term “ethnomethodology” and founded the field that goes by that name. He studied under Talcott Parsons (b. 1902–d. 1979), but radically transformed the structural-functionalist theory of action that Parsons developed in the 1930s and 1940s. Garfinkel’s distinctive empirical approach to social action and interaction drew upon Edmund Husserl’s (b. 1859–d. 1938) phenomenological analysis of the everyday life-world, which Alfred Schutz (b. 1899–d. 1959) developed for sociology. Garfinkel gave relatively little mention of the philosophy of ordinary language arising from the later philosophical work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (b. 1889–d. 1951), and developed in reference to the social sciences by Peter Winch (b. 1926–d. 1997), but others have drawn linkages between them. Ethnomethodological research describes the organization of situated activities, including commonsense reasoning and ordinary language use, as well as more specialized practices of playing music, solving mathematics problems, or performing scientific experiments. Although ethnomethodology initially developed as part of sociology, and is still recognized as a sociological subfield, it has made inroads into philosophy of social science, social anthropology, communication and information studies, education studies, and science and technology studies. The allied field of Conversation Analysis, founded by Harvey Sacks (1935–1975) and developed by his students and colleagues, has also made strong inroads into sociolinguistics and related areas of research on social interaction.</p>",sociology

In the legal sense, consumer credit only refers to unsecured debt (e.g., payday loans, credit card debt, car purchase loans, consumer loans); however, in the sociological literature, it is used more broadly to include also secured debt, such as home equity loans and mortgages. The social studies of consumer credit and debt draw on economic sociology, economic geography, political economy, organization theory, cultural sociology, and economic anthropology to examine the social, political, and cultural causes and consequences of indebtedness. The wider theoretical concern of this inquiry is not debt per se, but to understand how debt changes our answers to long-standing sociological questions relating to inequality, social relations, cultural change, power, and the connections between economy and society. This review starts with general-scope sociological (General Overviews) and social history (Social History of Credit and Debt) studies on debt, which explicate the broader sociological and cultural significance of widespread indebtedness. The review then covers the two main strands of the social study of credit and debt. The first focuses on the institutional causes of indebtedness, examining macropolitical and cultural shifts (Debt and Cultural Theory), economic policy and institutional differences across countries (Political Economy of Credit and Debt), meso-level, institutional processes (Making of Credit Markets: Institutions and Fields), and the development of credit products and credit scoring within financial institutions (Inside Financial Institutions: Banks and the Lending Process). The second angle focuses on borrowers, looking at the consequences of indebtedness on social inequalities (Credit, Debt, and Inequality); at the credit process—how households borrow, how it changes their everyday life, how they are affected by payment difficulties—unpacking the way debt impacts subjectivities, social relationships, and oppression through lived experiences (Borrowers and the Credit Process); and at opportunities for resistance (Debt Resistance, Financial Dissent, and the New Politics of Finance).

10.1177/00113921241292454,"This Current Sociology Monograph draws together six articles that broker novel concepts into economic sociology. To orient this enterprise, this article examines the concepts of creativity and novelty in social theory and explains why it is challenging work to broker concepts across intellectual communities. To understand the existing boundaries across which one could broker, it next describes how the subfield of economic sociology has been shaped by the separation of economics and sociology as distinct fields, which ultimately led to a decline of sociologists studying the economy. Two counter-acting organizational forces that sought to institutionalize a subfield of economic sociology was the formation in the mid-1970s of the International Sociological Association’s Research Committee on Economy and Society (ISA RC02), and the institutionalization in the mid-1980s of the New Economic Sociology. The latter became a global brand exported from the United States that eclipsed the former. The New Economic Sociology, a community of scholars primarily based in and focused on the United States and typically indifferent (if not skeptical) to neo-Marxist approaches and international political economy, became globally associated with what constitutes economic sociology (and what is not). Consequently, it would be beneficial to broker in concepts to economic sociology beyond the historic limitations of the New Economic Sociology.",sociology

Intensive sociological research on children has had a relatively short history, but in that time it has become an important contribution to the analysis of society. It has the capacity to serve as an x-ray or a magnifying glass, or just to provide an additional perspective in analysing social processes. It is clear from all the reports that sociological research and its social background are interdependent. Although childhood sociology has always been internationally oriented, there is a variety of themes and approaches and different emphases placed on particular topics in the different countries. Such differences can be traced back to the social definitions of childhood characterizing the respective societies. For almost all of the countries, however, there is only a weak connection between sociological research concerning children and the core domains of sociology. Some recommendations for future research development are outlined.",sociology

I emphasize two of his ideas. One is semiotics, which is virtually the same as the anthropologists’ concept of culture. This latter concept in turn was essential to clarifying the sociologists’ idea of the social or society. Peirce also created the modern theory of the dialogical self, which explained the symbolic character of human beings and proved foundational for social psychology. Politically Peirce was a right-wing conservative, but his ideas eventually contributed to the egalitarian views of cultures and sub-cultures. In addition his ideas contributed, by way of unanticipated consequences, to the 20th-century human rights revolutions in the American legal system. Thus he was both a founder of sociology and a founder of American political liberalism.",sociology
10.1177/0011392112456508,"This article aims at drawing on sociological insights into reconciliation processes which emerge out of ethnic, national and state conflicts. First, the concept of reconciliation is interrogated as an instrument for sociological enquiry. The article locates the concept’s lexical origins in western/northern Christian traditions and identifies the usages of religious connotations in secularised strands of conflict resolution theory and praxis. While acknowledging the problems involved in assuming a conceptual universality, the basic meaning of the concept is located in many different historical, religious and secular traditions across the globe. Once overcoming Christiano-centric and western/northern biases and limitations, reconciliation can be retrieved and operationalised as a sociological concept for understanding and comparing ethnically and other deeply divided societies. Second, the article argues for further development of sociological comparative perspectives on how societies deal with violent and divisive past, which enhances academic knowledge and may impact policy as regards reconciliation processes, both in terms of understanding the past as well as dealing with the present and future of post-conflict societies. A sociology of conflict and reconciliation offers frames for transferring knowledge and experience that transcends simplistic assumptions and enriches understanding of the complexities of conflict and its transformations.",sociology

It is still a fragmented field combining all the social sciences. Within the framework of a ‘return to the actor’, marked by interpretative theories and symbolic interactionism, some sociologists of education played an important part in this rediscovery, paying attention to ‘pupilhood’ ( métier d’élève), and then to the métier d’enfant. The new status of the child in modernity was thus scrutinized within the framework of theories of individualism. The main research trends are: a reflexive view of expert discourses, the child as a social actor, social policies and childhood and children’s culture. From the ‘king child’ to the ‘child as a victim’, the political, juridical and media scene is constantly fuelled by a number of heated debates about the new figures of childhood, the child of desire, the child as problem, the child at risk, or the dangerous child. The article ends with series of challenges for the future of the sociology of childhood.",sociology

Economic sociology is a fast-growing field of research in the US, and to a lesser extent in Europe, but it has barely registered in Australia. This is partly a reflection of the fact that economic sociology draws some of its inspiration from ‘new economy’ industries that are weak in Australia. It also reflects the influence of the Marxist tradition in Australia, focusing mainly on the state as a countervailing force to markets. The upshot is that the market is both a constant point of reference in sociological research, but also a ‘black box’ beyond social inquiry. The new economic sociology, in contrast, focuses upon the constitutive role of social institutions in relation to markets. It suggests promising new lines of inquiry in the Australian context.",sociology

Information on a series of variables was extracted after analyzing 118 articles that have focused on ‘social capital,’ written by Chinese sociologist and published between 2000 and 2011. The analysis results indicated an accelerated popularity of ‘social capital’ in Chinese sociological publications over this time period. In addition, the early adopters of ‘social capital’ among Chinese sociologists privileged the network domain but marginalized the social trust and civic participation domain of the concept, while recent years have witnessed a gradual embrace of the social trust and civic participation domains in Chinese sociologists’ writings. The trajectory of the cross-cultural encounter of ‘social capital’ is discussed in terms of China’s institutional context for the diffusion of this concept.",sociology

Although young people, for the most part, realize the value of folk culture as a whole, they rank its elements according to the degree of their compliance with the needs of modernity. Two groups of approximately equal size were distinguished. The first group is «iden-tification». It shares the position that if a modern person feels that he belongs to a certain ethnic group and is interested in preserving its traditions, he or she must know the folk culture well. The second group stands for «cultural diversity», which means that a modern person should know his or her folk culture well, but it is also important to navigate the cultural heritage of other peoples. Based on the results of the study, the conclusion about the need for a constant intergenerational dialogue for the preservation, transmission and reproduction of folk culture, which is the fundamental basis of the national mentality and the stability of society is made.",sociology

Writers in this perspective have attempted to integrate symbolic interactionism's powerful concepts of the self and the situation, phenomenological sociology's emphasis on the social construction of reality, and ethnomethodology's telling critique of conventional sociological theory and methods, with an innovative argument for the centrality of embodiment and feelings to human agency.

Existential sociologists expect, if not assume, change to be a constant feature of people's lives, their sense of self, their experience of the social world, the other people that populate the social world, and the culture that provides meaning for life. Everyday life is more than merely situational and problematic, a point on which all the varieties of everyday life sociology generally agree. Everyday life is

In contrast to Erving Goffman's dramaturgical model of social life, the drama that existential sociologists see in everyday life does not follow anyone else's script.

Sociologists are increasingly conceptualizing poverty, global economic inequality, and social inequalities of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation not as social problems, but rather as human rights abuses. The shift of emphasis from the social problems perspective to the human rights perspective demands a different set of remedies from IGOs, national governments, and local authorities. Whereas in the past sociologists tended either to recommend modifications to social policies or to propose large‐scale social transformation, they now find themselves advocating the implementation of human rights on the global, national, and local levels. This has brought sociologists into the area of global governance. The process of delineating an explicitly sociological perspective on human rights is impeded by two overlapping dilemmas: (1) the tension between an approach that emphasizes the analysis of ‘rights effects’ on the global, national, and local levels and an approach that stresses the advocacy of rights as a palliative for social inequalities; and (2) the tension between an interdisciplinary vision, in which sociology would join other disciplines in illuminating human rights and a unidisciplinary vision, in which sociologists and their allies would push for a unified social science founded on human rights.",sociology

The article argues that architecture (in a broad sense) is not a mere ‘reflection’ or ‘mirror’ of society, but rather a constitutive and transformative medium of the imaginary institution of society (Castoriadis), its assemblages (Deleuze), as well as its subjects (Foucault). In other words, it claims that architecture is a material and symbolic ‘mode’ through which societies and individuals are constituted and transformed. As architecture is a cultural technique, which is primarily enacted in relation to bodies, perceptions and affects (rather than in a discursive, reflective way), the social effects of architecture can best be understood and analysed through a comparative lens.

This contribution examines if sport sociology is able to serve the praxis in this expected manner and which functions sport sociology is able to accomplish over and above those problems which are directly related to the praxis functions which at the same time can serve as a justification.  This contribution shows that the idea, that science has to directly serve the praxis, is based on a false concept of science. Science is an independent social system formed according to its own rules and norms. Problems, which result from the relationship of science to other social spheres of existence that need scientific knowledge which result from these facts will be examined in detail. requirements. It should therefore not be a question of diminishing the differences, but of bridging these discrepancies without the application of knowledge being initially a case of coincidence. Those problems concerning the application of scientific knowledge which result from these facts will be examined in detail.  The second part of this contribution examines the functions which can be made available by sport sociology.  In addition to the enlargement of our information on our immediate field of action, the following functions can also be named: the relativization of our con ceptions and knowledge on the phenomenon of sport; the control and the re gulation of social conflicts and contradictory interests; the development of the social identity of sport organizations; the subdual of prejudice, idealization and tabus that sport often is confronted with.",sociology

As a contribution toward this framework, we define home as an emplaced relationship that prioritizes certain socio-material contexts over others, by virtue of the emotional, affective and practical values attached to them, in forms and degrees that change over space and time. This understanding highlights the interdependence between relational, cultural and structural aspects of home as a distinctive social experience. We then connect the sociological debate with the discourse on home across social sciences more broadly, with a particular emphasis on the heuristics, practices and multiscalarity of home. In terms of practical research, the methodological bases of ‘home studies’ are still in development, also regarding the prospects of translating and comparing home across socio-cultural and spatial contexts.

It is suggested that the sociology of health inequalities in Britain lacks an analysis of agency, and that such an analysis is crucial. A case is made that the recent critical realist contribution of Margaret Archer on ‘internal conversations’ lends itself to an understanding of agency that is salient here.

Sociologists are increasingly conceptualizing poverty, global economic inequality, and social inequalities of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation not as social problems, but rather as human rights abuses. The shift of emphasis from the social problems perspective to the human rights perspective demands a different set of remedies from IGOs, national governments, and local authorities. Whereas in the past sociologists tended either to recommend modifications to social policies or to propose large‐scale social transformation, they now find themselves advocating the implementation of human rights on the global, national, and local levels. This has brought sociologists into the area of global governance. The process of delineating an explicitly sociological perspective on human rights is impeded by two overlapping dilemmas: (1) the tension between an approach that emphasizes the analysis of ‘rights effects’ on the global, national, and local levels and an approach that stresses the advocacy of rights as a palliative for social inequalities; and (2) the tension between an interdisciplinary vision, in which sociology would join other disciplines in illuminating human rights and a unidisciplinary vision, in which sociologists and their allies would push for a unified social science founded on human rights.",sociology

This division of Sociology into different subfields is to a large extent related to methodology and choices between qualitative or quantitative research methods. Relying on theoretical constructs of the academic prestige economy, boundary demarcation and taste for research, we examine the methodological divide in generalist Sociology journals. Using automated text analysis for 8737 abstracts of articles published between 1995 and 2017, we discover evidence of this divide, but also of an entanglement between methodological choices and different research topics. Moreover, our results suggest a marginally increasing time trend for the publication of quantitative research in generalist journals.

More specifically, it explores the ramifications of the International Olympic Committee’s Host City Contract from 2024 onwards.

Rather than resuming ideas on a ‘syncretised’ sociology as a response to the burdens of methodological nationalism and Eurocentrism, this article uses the IOC contract as an example and lessons from the Fédération de Internationale de Football Association’s (FIFA) work on human rights to argue that there is an unexplored potential in improving sociological ethnographic research by adapting it to the specifics of a topic.",sociology

In other words, it claims that architecture is a material and symbolic ‘mode’ through which societies and individuals are constituted and transformed. As architecture is a cultural technique, which is primarily enacted in relation to bodies, perceptions and affects (rather than in a discursive, reflective way), the social effects of architecture can best be understood and analysed through a comparative lens. Finally, therefore, the article unfolds a tableau of diverse architectural modes of collective existence, thus providing an overview of different socio-architectural constellations. Such a comparative and synchronical view of different societies allows for a sociology of architecture which analyses architectural transformations – both historical and contemporary.",sociology

It is an expression of existing social conditions, which determine how we perceive and control our physical selves, how we use our body as an expressive medium, how we handle our body and control it, how we make use of our bodies, and how we view our body. When we speak of our body as a social fact, we mean the following four elements:  a) the ""techniques of the body"", or in other words, the way motion (e.g., walking, running, jumping, swimming) is traditionally realized in a society;  b) ""expressive body movement"" such as posture, gesture, facial expressions and so on, which serve as symbolic forms of self-expression and of (non-verbal) communication; hence, as ""body language"";  c) ""body ethos"" or the attitude towards one's own body, which match person al and social identity;  d) controls of drive and need.  Every society recognizes, and also usually differentiates on a class and gen der-specific basis, a norm for each of these dimensions of the body which firmly establishes body techniques, expressive body movement, body ethos, and physical self-control. Such norms apply to all bodily movements and to the control of drives and needs; hence also to sports.  What is ""possible"" and ""not possible"" in sports, what is acceptable in bodily exertion, body control, posture, which presentation of the body is acceptable for men and women, for old and young, for members of the lower or the upper class, is defined by just such social norms and rules, that determine the body as a social fact.  These relationships should be examined in detail, if we wish to judge the significance of body sociology for the sociology of sports. For this, it is necessary:  1) to make clear the anthropological prerequisites of a sociology of the body,  2) to describe the already mentioned individual components of the body as a social fact to classify its socio-cultural, class and gender-specific differentiations and,  3) to treat the specific dependence-relationship of the body as a social fact upon social development.",sociology

Central to the debate on sociology as a discipline and practice were efforts to document its history and paradigmatic shifts that characterized it, as well as topical themes that defined its research. One key observation in its evolution pointed to a historical shift from being a service discipline to the previous racially segregatory political regimes, especially between the early 1900s and 1960s, to a multi-paradigm discipline that challenged the racial order and inequalities in the 1970s onwards. This period marked the height of public sociology. Recent observations, however, especially in the post-apartheid period, projected a scenario of the discipline in a state of decline. Counter-evidence was nevertheless also presented suggesting not only the renewal of sociology in South Africa but also its active interest and involvement in the struggle against inequalities as part of the voices of the poor. This article calls these observations as the decline thesis and the renewal thesis, and contrasts them. The latter, I argue, is more compelling than the former.

There was little evidence of progress in the teaching of quantitative skills, nor was computing yet seen to be a core element of the curriculum. The documents also revealed a continuing problem over the place of methods teaching as a whole in relation to other parts of the curriculum as reflected both in time allocation and in assessment weighting.

By taste one classifies oneself and is classified by others. Understood in this way, the sociological concept of taste shares many important features with its predecessor in classical philosophical aesthetics, the power of judgment. In this capacity, taste does not just refer either to individual preferences or dispositions (the term used by Bourdieu), or to some standards used in making choices in consumption.

Our purpose here is to place these literatures in conversation with each other.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0211,"<p>Classification is fundamental to social life. It is the prerequisite to all other social activity. Before language, family, power, or organization, there must be rules for expressing sameness and difference, for defining what is or is not an instance of something, and there must be rules for how these distinctions are connected. Understanding space, time, or causal relationships, that something is an “independent” or “dependent variable” and that they are connected to each other, are social relationships that depend on classification; so, too, is the discovery of chance and the understanding of life in stochastic, probabilistic terms. Classification can be a simple distinction of kinds (this is an animal, that is not), but it is usually organized into systems of division and hierarchy, of more and less, better and worse. Kinship is about who and how we are connected to family or clan or tribe. Nationalism is about how someone is a citizen and the kinds of relationships that citizens and noncitizens have. Power is about who and when someone has the right to impose their will on others. And status is about social worth that is distributed based on race, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexual preferences, what people buy, who is beautiful, who is good at sports, and so on. Sociologists may take categories for granted, but some branches—those who study culture, politics, or race—are especially concerned with how classifications emerge, spread, or change over time. Changes in economic or political relationships often require a reclassification of worth or merit. And the terms that define categories are most often controlled by those who most benefit from them; however, efforts to resist power often involve challenging categories favoring the powerful.</p>",sociology

The sociology of religion is concerned with the multiplicity of ways in which religion is part of human society and thus it focuses on its institutional, cultural, and individual expression across varying social, geographical, and historical contexts. A common typology is to differentiate between substantive and functional approaches to studying religion. The former is concerned with the symbolic contents or meanings contained within a religious worldview and the latter with religion's purposes or functions in society. Following Weber's (1958) analysis of the doctrinal tenets of the Calvinist ethic, substantive approaches focus on delineating particular religious beliefs, defined in terms of concerns about transcendence and other‐worldly salvation, and how these beliefs are understood and give meaning to everyday life.",sociology

Based on the so-called double periphery – the peripheral location of Argentine sociology in the western social sciences, but also of cultural research within local sociology – the author seeks to analyze the emergence of this subdiscipline. It owes to both the concern for mass culture and its relationship with populism at the end of the 1960s. At that time, these studies were being done by researchers with training in literary criticism, researchers who approached cultural phenomena as a political concern, in a way similar to what occurred when British cultural studies were born. At the end of Argentina’s last dictatorship (1976–1983), the reappearance and growth of a sociology of culture expanded into Nomadic terrains and into varied themes and institutions: this was due to a proliferation of studies in social communication and new university departments, but it can also be attributed to the influence of Brazilian anthropology. Another factor is the delayed creation of graduate programs and their clearly multidisciplinary nature. Today the field is testing its potential while undergoing both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, it is essential to re-examine the field’s sociological aspects as it moves along this path.",sociology

An energetic founding group created a network of departments, assembled a workforce and were rewarded with rapid growth. Their intellectual project emphasized data collection, scientificity and social reform, closely modelled on sociology in the global metropole. Underneath was a mostly functionalist concept of ‘a society’ and a strong conviction that Australian society was a case of modernity. They succeeded in creating an empiricist science, which played a role in Australian reformism in the 1970s and 1980s, and reached a high point in the work of Jean Martin. However many younger sociologists were dissatisfied with the founders’ science and launched other knowledge projects in the following decades. The founders’ strategy for making sociology in Australia led to a deep contradiction about Australian coloniality, unresolved in contemporary sociology.",sociology

Both Weber and Schumpeter wrote voluminously on capitalism, as testified to by such giant works as Economy and Society (Weber, 1978c [1922]) and Business Cycles (Schumpeter, 1939). One can also discern a distinct development in their thought over time: from emphasizing the role of various voluntaristic elements (such as the spirit of capitalism and the spirit of entrepreneurship) to stressing the role of institutions. The puzzle that one can find in their writings is as follows. Weber and Schumpeter both argue that a vigorous and healthy capitalism requires certain economic and non-economic institutions, in addition to something else. An absence of this ‘something else’ may lead to capitalist petrification or collapse, according to both authors. The answers of Weber and Schumpeter to the above puzzle, it is shown in the article, is somewhat different in their early and in their later works.",sociology

These ‘paradigm wars’ reached something of a zenith around the time of the final opus of a key proponent, Alvin Gouldner, in 1979. An uneasy truce was then reached under new conditions of growing economic rationalism. While mainstream academic sociology plunged into the ‘coming crisis’ foretold by Gouldner, a number of its graduates continued to develop reflexive sociology, particularly in non-academic workplaces. Initially called - after Kuhn - the ‘new paradigm’ or ‘critical interpretivism’, it is now known by many names. Most common descriptors would be participatory or action research, action learning or socio systems-thinking. The approach has gradually achieved surprising critical mass in enormously diverse organizational, workplace and community settings worldwide. The article concludes by noting that many ‘new paradigm’ assumptions have begun to enter mainstream social research, which may be beginning to reengage with the action research field - originally the offspring of sociological thinking three decades earlier.",sociology

10.1177/1749975520922469,"When analyzing literary fiction, most cultural sociologists still accept the well-established boundaries between the literary and the sociological, thus leaving literature stripped of its aesthetic qualities. Instead, I propose a new approach that focuses on the process of meaning-making as it occurs within the interaction between the reader and the novel in a given socio-historical setting. This allows analysts to capture those aspects of understanding social experience which are usually ‘lost in translation’ between fictional and sociological genres. My major claims are that, first, when referring to social experience, both sociological and literary texts employ aesthetic devices to mediate understanding for the reader. Second, within the literary genre, the understanding of social experience relies much more on the emotional engagement of the reader through a reading process facilitated by these aesthetic devices. Third, to benefit methodologically and epistemologically from the lyrical understanding of social experience mediated by literature, cultural sociologists must be particularly sensitive to the subtlety and ambiguity of meanings mediated by the aesthetic. The methodological advantage gained is the analysis of deeper cultural meanings grounded in, yet also going beyond, an emotionally and existentially experienced social reality, which is intersubjectively shared and filtered by various groups of readers and cultural intermediaries. The epistemological advantage gained by overcoming the assumed inferiority of literature is that cultural sociological research unlocks a whole new area for understanding the meanings of social life, especially its non-discursive dimensions. The research model I propose for a new sociology of literature adopts the landscape of meaning concept developed by Isaac Reed in combination with the aesthetic structuralism of Czech linguist Jan Mukařovský. This model will be demonstrated through an interpretive analysis of the Czech novel Sestra (published in English as City Sister Silver) by Jáchym Topol.",sociology

Aron’s approach to the nature of political sociology is, it is argued, deeply influenced by the German — particularly Weberian — understanding of the social sciences as a hermeneutic enterprise concerned with meaning, and by Montesquieu’s analysis of regimes in terms of their (essential) nature, principles and the sources of their potential ‘corruption’. Aron’s analysis provides not only an account of totalitarian regimes in a late, developed stage, but also an analytical snapshot of Western pluralist democracies at the high point of ‘sociological liberalism’. The final section of the paper seeks to identify some differences between Aron’s account of democracy and that contained in contemporary debates on ‘governance’. The striking differences that emerge make Aron’s analysis relevant as an account of a high-tide mark of democracy grounded in a particular mix of party competition and compromise.",sociology
10.1177/0011392107070134,"The aim of this article is to discuss the relationship between economic sociology and economic policies. In the last few decades, economic sociology has made significant achievements in terms of theory and research, but its influence on policies has remained weak. While this was inevitable in earlier decades, when scholars had to concentrate most of their effort on defining the role and contribution of economic sociology, it has since become a constraint for the institutionalization and recognition of the discipline. The return to economic sociology, since the 1980s, has brought about important theoretical achievements, especially in the analysis of economic organization at the micro level in terms of social and cultural embeddedness. The role of social relations in contemporary economy has clearly emerged, but its implications for policies to promote economic development have remained more latent so far. Although a weaker institutionalization and a poorer connection to policy-making certainly affect the political influence of economic sociology in comparison to economics, the article focuses on the research perspective. A shift of the research focus from the statics to the dynamics of economic organization could be useful. In this framework, particular attention is drawn to the study of local development and innovation through a closer relationship of economic sociology with comparative political economy. A separation between these two approaches does not favour a full exploitation of the potential contribution of economic sociology to policies.",sociology
10.1177/00113921221090253,"This article asks whether we need a posthumanist sociology, arguing that such a perspective can export a good deal of useful methodological and theoretical insight into the sociological toolbox. A posthumanist sociology is not a flattened ontology, in which we find agency in all things living and non-living. A posthumanist sociology asks instead what we do with the fundamental question of becoming both more and less human, following a surge of interest in decentring human exceptionalism. Moreover, a posthumanist sociology returns to the question of what it means to be an intersectional being, to proliferate the involvement of entities at the intersections of histories and social structures. Thus, it is a perspective that emerges from within the conditions of related crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has highlighted the need to decentre human exceptionalism, raising a challenge for sociologists to return to the premises of what it means to be a social being. In some sense, management of the pandemic already assumes a decentring. This article builds an argument by first reviewing what broadly constitutes a ‘posthumanist’ sociological perspective, then moves on to a case study of the interrelated human and non-human actors that constituted the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The case study usefully marks the intersection between human and non-human bodies as nodes in the interpretive production chain of this global event – one that acknowledges human extensions and connections to multispecies and ecological systems. Such interlinkages become foundational to interrogating what it means to become human in a posthuman world. The article ends on this posthuman question: under the posthuman condition, if we do not discern a difference between the human and other-than-human entities, how will this homogenization affect the human collective ability to enact and maintain cross-species and cross-entity protections?",sociology

Here the social field is described as made up of multiple propagations of desires and beliefs that spread from one individual to other, taking countless directions, interfering with each other, forming networks, and escaping them in search of new connections.

Early preoccupation with community studies and the fate of the Welsh language gave way to questions of economic decline and structural inequality. Themes of uneven development, social and economic restructuring and internal colonialism were explored. The nature of Welsh identity was problematised.

This article outlines the sociology of loss as a project for sociological engagement with climate change, one that breaks out of environmental sociology as the conventional silo of research and bridges to other subfields. I address four interrelated dimensions of loss that climate change presents: the materiality of loss; the politics of loss; knowledge of loss; and practices of loss. Unlike “sustainability”—the more dominant framing in the social sciences of climate change—the sociology of loss examines what does, will, or must disappear rather than what can or should be sustained.

To evaluate the extent to which family sociology has kept pace with these changes the article first reviews four prominent sociology journals from 1993 to 2011, investigating the range of family types covered in published articles over nearly two decades and the kinds of approaches taken to study non-traditional families. The article then presents two case studies of research areas that have always been central to family studies – reproduction and household labor – to review how changes in family structure impact core family processes and alter the approaches for studying them. The advent of assisted reproductive technologies and the range of living arrangements in which the division of household labor now occurs challenge the parameters of the ‘traditional’ family. The findings indicate that family sociologists have been slow to rethink underlying categories of analysis, methodological approaches and scope of inquiry in the wake of significant changes in family experience.

In his sociology, probably more than anywhere else, taste is a central theoretical concept of analysis. By distinguishing between good and bad, tasteful and tasteless, beautiful and ugly, taste classifies and orders the natural and social world. By taste one classifies oneself and is classified by others. Understood in this way, the sociological concept of taste shares many important features with its predecessor in classical philosophical aesthetics, the power of judgment. In this capacity, taste does not just refer to individual preferences, or dispositions (the term used by Bourdieu), or to some standards used in making choices in consumption. It is an important concept in bridging the gap between an individual's choices and his/her socially shared preferences or habits.

Until the 1970s, scholarship on social movements largely neglected questions of feminism and gender, and the fields of gender and social movements consisted of separate literatures. As a result, the major theories of social movements failed to take into account the impact of gender on the emergence, nature, and outcomes of social movements. But as mass feminist activism flourished in the United States and around the globe, so too did scholarship on gender and social movements. The earliest work in this area focused on women’s movements, both feminist and antifeminist, and applied the concepts and perspectives of social movement theory without explicitly taking into consideration the impact of gender. These studies, along with research on men’s movements, brought gender to the attention of social movement scholars by acknowledging women’s participation in political protest and men’s political experiences in gender movements, which had been ignored by mainstream social movement theory. But this body of work failed to consider systematically the effects of gender on political activism. By the 1990s, a new wave of research began to reconceptualize the relationship between gender and social movements by attending not only to how gender affects social movement structures and processes, but how social movements, in turn, affect gender. Many social movements have targeted the structures, cultural practices, and interactional norms that sustain gender inequality. Further, movements that are not oriented specifically around gender issues are also shaped by gender as a central feature of social structure, culture, and everyday life. Scholarship at the intersection of the fields of gender and social movements has had a significant impact on the cultural turn in social movement research, as well as on mainstream theories of social movements. Examining social movements through a gender lens has advanced several areas of social movement inquiry: (1) collective identity and intersectionality, (2) collective action frames, (3) movement leadership and organizations, (4) political and cultural opportunity structures and constraints, (5) movement tactics and strategies, and (6) movement outcomes. The research in this subfield and, correspondingly, this article, focuses primarily—but not exclusively—on the United States. The literature on gender and social movements has exposed many underexplored dimensions of social activism and has been foundational for the development of intersectional approaches to social movements. There is still much to learn by applying an intersectional approach that considers how power structures such as race, class, gender, and nationality intersect and the implications for social movement processes.</p>",sociology

               The origins of American sociology are bathed in religious homogeneity masked by a sense of Protestantism as pluralism. The review of the founding theorists of American sociology between 1881 and 1915 makes it perfectly plain that a certain cultural uniformity existed among figures as diverse as Lester F. Ward, William Sumner, Franklin Giddings, Charles H. Cooley, Albion Small, and Edward Ross.1 The context of discourse rested on issues derived from evolutionism in biology and associationism in psychology. And whether the views expressed were liberal or conservative, they scarcely deviated from the norms of an America immersed in Protestantism and nationalism.",sociology

The growth of women in prison in the 2010s has outpaced the growth of male prisoners. Not only are women a growing prison population, they are also a unique prison population. Women prisoners, compared to their male counterparts, are more likely to have histories of abuse and neglect and have greater incidents of substance abuse and mental health concerns. Women prisoners are also more likely to be the primary caretakers of children under the age of eighteen. The incarceration of women, then, has a substantial impact not only on the women who experience it, but on their families. Women prisoners also pose a unique challenge for correctional officials. The US correctional system was developed for males and is staffed and run largely by men. As such, risk assessment tools and in-prison programming do not consider the special needs of women prisoners. However, when programming takes into consideration women’s unique pathways into crime, they are much more effective. This article considers, in turn, each of these issues, beginning with a historical understanding of women’s prisons. Next, we consider the role of gender in risk assessment tools and prison programming, and the special issues surrounding women in prison, including female sexuality and parenting in prison.

Thirty years later, it is estimated that around 36 million people are living with HIV, with 95 percent living in low‐ and middle‐income countries (UNAIDS, 2013). There is at present no cure for AIDS and no effective prophylactic vaccine for HIV, and the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In 1996 a successful treatment was developed, anti‐retro viral therapy (ART), which blocks HIV from entering the body's immune cells to effectively slow the progression from HIV to AIDS to death. As a result the number of AIDS deaths is declining with 1.6 million AIDS deaths in 2012, down from 2.3 million in 2005. Although ART lowers the viral load, it does not eradicate the virus in those infected, and the number of people living with HIV worldwide (HIV prevalence) is increasing. Furthermore, for every person who initiates treatment, between three and four more persons become infected. On a more positive note, since 1999, the year in which it is thought that the epidemic peaked globally, the number of new infections (HIV incidence) has fallen. The overall growth of the global epidemic appears to have stabilized with the annual number of new HIV infections steadily declining; although levels remain high with around 2.3 million new infections globally in 2012, a 33 percent decline from 3.4 million in 2001 (UNAIDS, 2013).",sociology

The review is based on the study of programmatic statements, the character of references in sociological writings, and available biographical information on their authors. All of these help to locate Soviet sociology within the intellectual enterprise in general and to establish whether it is actually a counterpart of what is called “sociology” in the West, or a different branch of intellectual activity which for some reason uses its name. Most of the findings are derived from an analysis of Sotsiogicheskie lssledovania (Sociological Research), the only specifically sociological journal in the USSR, published since 1974. These findings are compared with parallel observations on representative samples of the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review. The conclusion is that Soviet sociology, although it uses some of the methods of Western sociology, is an activity of a different nature on the whole. It is a branch of social technology, a managerial science oriented towards the promotion of the goals and the increase of the ideological and administrative efficiency of the Soviet government.",sociology

In view of the rela tively low esteem accorded to sport sociology (at least in the United States) it may be proper to emphasize that the problems discussed above are by no means limited to the area of sport sociology. Indeed, they are to be found in the most respectable literature of fields more in the ""mainstream"" of sociology (see Deutscher, 1973; Hirschi and Selvin, 1967). Hopefully, a continuing concern for better methodology among sport sociologists will help us to draw on the methodological wisdom of ""general sociology"" and other related fields without repeating the errors that have been made by scholars in those fields.  A number of recent papers and exchanges in this journal and elsewhere have marked an apparent growth of interest in methodological issues among sport socio logists (e.g., Loy and Seagrave, 1974; Albonico and Pfister-Binz, 1971; McPherson, 1975: Wohl, 1975). This trend, especially the emergence of exchanges and discus sions regarding the relative merit of different methodological approaches (cf.

It is also a potentially difficult topic for sociology because of the importance sociology attaches to culture and context. The sociology of science has emphasised the continuity between scientific expertise and more traditional forms of knowledge. Whilst this suggests an increasing ‘democratisation of expertise’ is desirable, it also risks erasing the idea of expertise itself. This might be particularly detrimental for sociology as it restricts the role of sociological inquiry to examining how expert status is attributed rather than understanding what expertise is. This paper describes these developments and contrasts them with other approaches in which expertise appears less important. It concludes by setting out a new approach to expertise that respects the role of culture in generating knowledge but, by stressing the importance of socialisation and experience, argues for a more nuanced conception of expertise as both real and unequally distributed.",sociology

In 1968, the violent governmental reaction to the student movement changed the vision of a peaceful progress according to the so-called “Mexican Miracle.” Under the new social circumstances and the expectations generated by the outbreak of the Cuban Revolution, the decade of the 1970s was characterized by the eruption of Marxism in the universities. Due to the rise of authoritarianism and the growth of military regimes in Latin America, many South American intellectuals arrived at Mexico as professors in the social science departments. Sociology experienced a process of expansion both in student enrollment and in the founding of journals and new academic institutions. The chapter analyses these transformations together with the changes to the sociology curricula, in the main journals, and publications, in the studies undertaken by Mexican sociologists, as well as the contributions from foreign authors that had an important impact in Mexican social science.",sociology

However, an unreflexive ‘neo-orthodoxy’ has emerged in recent years that is constrained by a series of dualistic and (critical) realist assumptions which inhibit the development of this distinctive sociology of work. This article contends that the potential of LPA can best be fulfilled through a renewal of critical reflection upon the foundational assumptions of LPA that can open up an acknowledgement and appreciation of the embroilment of subjectivity in the reproduction and transformation of production relations. This development is consistent with the central analytical importance ascribed to the ‘indeterminacy of labour’ in LPA but invites the adoption of a negative ontology in order to advance a less narrow conception of its meaning and significance. Studies of the new media and creative industries are engaged to indicate how a revitalized labour process analysis might embrace this ontology as a way of exploring and explaining the radical contingency of organization in contemporary social relations.",sociology

This approach is based on Polanyi's critically debated contribution which allows for an empirical study of the diversity of institutional structures and of the significance of configurations of insertion within different social networks. Such diversity results from the double movement of disembeddedness and re-embeddedness caused by the spread of constantly emerging market opportunities, and by the importance held by the historically and culturally different selective processes of path dependency in the construction of the institutions of social regulation and of the socialized preferences of economic actors. Within these processes attention is given to the transformation of social systems based on reciprocity (household, kin, social capital networks, etc.), associations of shared interests, forms of economic organization (in a plurality of coexisting ‘economies’), unequal distribution of power, and political intervention.",sociology
10.1177/0038038516656994,"Professor Akiwowo propounded the Asuwada Theory of Sociation in the 1980s as a contextual episteme to explain African social experience. The theory particularly attempts an indigenous postulation to social interactions among Africans in general and the Yoruba in particular. Its concepts attempt to emphasise contextual values of social beings who would contribute to social survival and community integration and development. This theory postulates that among Africans in general and the Yoruba in particular, the need to associate or co-exist by internalising and rightly exhibiting socially approved values of community survival and development, is integral to local social structure, as failure to co-exist potentially endangers the community. A deviant who defaults in sociating values is deemed a bad person ( omoburuku), while the one who sociates is the good person ( omoluabi). This theoretical postulation contrasts western social science theories (especially sociological Structuralist (macro) and Social Action (micro) theories), which rather emphasise rationality and individualism (at varied levels depending on the theory). Western social science ethnocentrically depicts African communal and kin ways of life as primitive and antithetical to development. Western social science theories have remained dominant and hegemonic over the years while Akiwowo’s theory is largely unpopular even in Nigerian social science curricula in spite of its potential for providing contextual interpretations for indigenous ways of life that are still very much extant despite dominant western modernity.

Of central concern is whether the rural sociological enterprise, a potentially vital source of information and guidance on such diverse issues, will be able to effectively respond to such challenges. The author argues that in order to strengthen its relevance and viability in coming years, the rural sociological profession must embrace three important shifts. First, it must modify the manner in which it engages in the production of new knowledge by pursuing a more balanced portfolio of investments in disciplinary and transdisciplinary research. Second, it must take a bold step to build bridges to new entities whose missions, goals, and values closely align with those of the Rural Sociological Society. And third, it must take a more proactive role in generating quality, scientifically sound information that is aligned with the needs of federal and state policy communities, particularly information that can better articulate how policies are likely to impact rural people and places.",sociology

This review identifies global inequality and disease‐related stigma as key social determinants of health and central problems improving health outcomes. Within global health, there is a growing discourse surrounding health disparities, particularly among the world's most disadvantaged populations. Additionally, the field notes an increase in global health nonprofits, international governmental organizations (IGOs), and regulatory bodies. As such, this paper examines the scope of empirical global health research with consideration of inequality and stigma as well as the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in health outcomes for the developing world. The review also discusses the role of IGOs and global health regulatory bodies in shaping development and health outcomes. A broad review of literature finds that although chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are currently the largest cause of poor health in the world's most impoverished nations, these are largely untargeted by NGO efforts, which may exacerbate the state of global inequality. However, the impact that NGOs could have on ameliorating the effects of NCDs remains understudied and is a promising direction for future scholarly efforts.",sociology

The aim of this article is to achieve that, while returning to the basic premise that sociology is the primary discipline that charts changes within the world-society. Two typical subjects for the sociology of globalization can be distinguished: defining what is ‘global’ at first sight and the identification of similar changes in (almost) all countries. However, can national-born concepts help to explain these subjects? This is debated by considering the sociology of social movements (Touraine) and the sociology of the elite (Aron and Rocher) to explain power in the study of alterglobalist movements.

Some (e.g. Durkheim, Weber, and critical realists) have attempted to demarcate social reality as a causally autonomous and qualitatively distinct realm in a segmented/stratified universe. Others (e.g. Tarde, Spencer, Luhmann, sociobiologists, and actor-network theorists) have postulated a more open (or flat) ontological space and blurred such demarcations by either rejecting the causal autonomy of sociological phenomena, or their qualitative distinctiveness, or both. So far, there has been little convergence between these two orientations since according to the former, the opening of the boundaries is likely to give way to reductionist conceptions of society, whereas the latter tends to associate rigid boundaries with essentialism. Through a close examination of these opposing orientations, the article aims to shed light on current ontological dilemmas of sociology.",sociology

Recent developments in the human sciences and psychology assist in making this link. They can be used to extend the original insights of the early Chicago School of sociology, particularly as regards the formation of human identities. Nevertheless, there remain substantial arguments as to how `the Chicago School's biotic level' should be conceptualised and how we envisage its links to the more conscious, pre-planned, aspects of human behaviour.

This is partly explained by several decades of Catholic institutional dominance.

Within this context university-based sociologists and sociologies have often been perceived as self-marginalised figures and paradigms.

The sociology of science has emphasised the continuity between scientific expertise and more traditional forms of knowledge. Whilst this suggests an increasing ‘democratisation of expertise’ is desirable, it also risks erasing the idea of expertise itself. This might be particularly detrimental for sociology as it restricts the role of sociological inquiry to examining how expert status is attributed rather than understanding what expertise is.

It introduces ‘heterodox economics’ as a body of thought that emerged in response to the failure of mainstream economics to theorise coherently the capitalist system as a whole, suggesting that heterodox economics is potentially an aid to overcoming the historical split between economics and sociology. The article argues that, beyond understanding the crisis, an alliance of sociology and heterodox economics can help strategically and politically in challenging and overcoming the theory, ideology and policy advice of mainstream economics. It can also help broaden ideas about how society and economy may be organised in a post-crisis future.",sociology

This approach is based on Polanyi's critically debated contribution which allows for an empirical study of the diversity of institutional structures and of the significance of configurations of insertion within different social networks. Such diversity results from the double movement of disembeddedness and re-embeddedness caused by the spread of constantly emerging market opportunities, and by the importance held by the historically and culturally different selective processes of path dependency in the construction of the institutions of social regulation and of the socialized preferences of economic actors. Within these processes attention is given to the transformation of social systems based on reciprocity (household, kin, social capital networks, etc.), associations of shared interests, forms of economic organization (in a plurality of coexisting ‘economies’), unequal distribution of power, and political intervention.",sociology

In 1968, the violent governmental reaction to the student movement changed the vision of a peaceful progress according to the so-called “Mexican Miracle.” Under the new social circumstances and the expectations generated by the outbreak of the Cuban Revolution, the decade of the 1970s was characterized by the eruption of Marxism in the universities. Due to the rise of authoritarianism and the growth of military regimes in Latin America, many South American intellectuals arrived at Mexico as professors in the social science departments. Sociology experienced a process of expansion both in student enrollment and in the founding of journals and new academic institutions.

It adapts a central question of sociological concern — how humanity transforms itself as it interacts with nature — to ask questions about how human subjectivities are affected by the increasing `humanization' of the universe and by developments in contemporary cosmology. The argument presented is that some (wealthy) sectors of society are increasingly relating to the universe in a narcissistic fashion, the roots of which can be found in the Renaissance `universal man'. At the same time, marginalized and less powerful people continue to experience the universe as a subject dominating their Earthly lives, a relationship heightened by the use of the universe in military and surveillance operations as well as abstract cosmologies. Problems with both these relationships with the universe are highlighted.",sociology

This article contends that the potential of LPA can best be fulfilled through a renewal of critical reflection upon the foundational assumptions of LPA that can open up an acknowledgement and appreciation of the embroilment of subjectivity in the reproduction and transformation of production relations. This development is consistent with the central analytical importance ascribed to the ‘indeterminacy of labour’ in LPA but invites the adoption of a negative ontology in order to advance a less narrow conception of its meaning and significance.

Their interface and areas of overlap have mostly been shaped by theoretical positions broadly considered “social constructionist.” Taken together, these perspectives provide empirical and theoretical tools to analyze important questions about how social inequalities, forms of scientific knowledge, and patterns of human health come to be produced and feedback into one another. Examining their intersection enables sociological questions such as: How is medical and public health scientific knowledge produced, stabilized, and taken as fact? How are scientific facts about health and illness used, experienced, and challenged? What is the relationship between health inequalities and public health or medical knowledge? This article seeks to briefly trace the important contributions that social constructionist research has made at the interstices of medical sociology and STS, further clarifying the history, points of intersection, and areas of diversion between them.

In the pre-state era, sociological thought thrived within the context of the socialist Zionism. The two prominent ‘proto-sociologists' were Arthur Ruppin and Martin Buber, who professed German communal perspectives. 2. Modernization sociology. The formative phase of sociology as a discipline was from 1950 to 1977. It was led by Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt, who effected a transition from the German anti-modernist paradigm to an American modernization theory. 3. Critical sociology. The critical phase took place in the 1970s and 1980s. Critical sociology was manifested in elitism, pluralism, Marxism, feminism and colonization approaches. Simultaneously there emerged a robust branch of ‘quantitative sociology’. 4. Post-modern sociology. The turn towards post-modernity started in the 1990s.

Because of the political environment within which they worked, Soviet researchers of culture had to employ strategies of resistance to survive. The three most common were: finding niches in related, ideologically neutral disciplines; doing purely empirical work; or, in contrast, critiquing ‘bourgeois social theories’. They also opted to work in the modes of reading rather than writing, oral discussions rather than publishing, and communication with like-minded colleagues rather than debates with opponents.

One of the grounding ideas of visual sociology is that “valid scientific insight in society can be acquired by observing, analyzing and theorizing its visual manifestations: behavior of people and material products of culture” (Pauwels 2010: 546). Visual sociology aims to normalize the use of visual imagery as a valid and relevant type of data for sociological research. Visual sociology allows for using mixed methods, where quantitative and qualitative ones show different aspects of the studied phenomenon. Some recent studies on modern media, such as YouTube, demonstrate that both quantitative and qualitative methods can be combined (Vergani &amp; Zuev 2011). One of the important postulates in sociological analyses is consideration of image as data, and not as an illustration or embellishment of a sociological argument. A single image, a sequence of images, and even a repository of images cannot serve as visual sociology arguments in themselves without analyzing them utilizing sociological theory (thereby also developing the theoretical tool). Visual sociological analysis can be also presented with no images at all. Radically speaking, visual sociology can even analyze non‐visual data, for example, when interviewing people on how they create, interpret, and circulate images. In this case visual sociologists analyze data related to the social world around images and not specific images themselves.",sociology

This chapter introduces four prominent Latin American sociologists of religion: Roberto Blancarte’s work on laicity; the critical analysis of Cristián Parker on popular religions within multiple modernities; Hugo José Suárez’s conceptualization of “para-ecclesiastical agents,” a key concept for understanding religious collective practice in Latin America; and Eloisa Martin’s proposal of the heuristic potential of analyzing practices of sacralization for understanding popular religion in Latin America.",sociology

If meaning is to be so central, then the theoretical tools that the humanities have developed to investigate art and language must become central to the human sciences more generally. The `thick descriptions' Geertz proposes for social science are powerful reconstructions of the empirical, not simply detailed observations. Likewise, the local knowledge Geertz valorized is inevitably rooted in more encompassing, global meaning-structures, even while every global theme becomes not enriched but different as it emerges locally. Interests can never be objective, and extra-individual structures are both cultural and social at the same time.Yet, while structures are central, they take form only through contingent process, and intertwining them is what Geertz's turn to performance was about.",sociology

The article demonstrates that Labour Process Theory (LPT) has been a crucial resource in the sociology of work, especially in the UK; core propositions of LPT provide it with resources for resilience (to counter claims of rival perspectives) and innovation (to expand the scope and explanator y power of the sociology of work).

For a long time, the contribution of sociologists was in the vein of apologetics. They formulated functionalist explanations to show that new immigrants had to be pressured into assimilation. Homogenization of the increasingly variegated Jewish population was presented as a scientifically warranted goal, while groups who were not of ‘western’ origin and those defined as minority groups could be relegated to ‘otherness’ and ‘difference’. The self-presentation of Israel as ‘Jewish and democratic’ was supported by sociological theorizing about Israel as a ‘unique’ sociopolitical phenomenon. The patent theoretical and practical contradictions of the ideology tended to be explained away and for several decades of the state's existence, the official ideology was all but unchallenged. With the growth of the academic community of sociologists, and, paradoxically, with the dynamic right-wing changes in politics, economics and culture in train since the 1980s, sociology is increasingly coming into its own. More researchers now attempt to make sense of the changes in ways that are attuned to contradictions. They look at (Israeli) society as a universal multi-factor processthat is subject to discoverable social laws; take as subject matter not what society oughtto be, but primarily what society actually is; and increasingly sift statements and conclusions founded on empirical datain their aspiration to scientific truth.",sociology

I note oft‐stated critiques of the positivist model relevant to rural sociology's “methodological monism,” including imprecise measurement, low levels of predictability, and a social psychological orientation. I suggest, in addition, that methodological homogeneity in rural sociology presents social life as social facts rather than social process, leads to a simplistic understanding of the interview, and separates the researcher from the experience of research. A wider methodological orientation would, I suggest, encourage the examination of a wider range of issues and encourage wider participation in a subdiscipline which, because of its particular history, has developed in isolation from mainstream sociology.",sociology

This change is caused both directly, by physical changes in the environment, and indirectly, through the appraisals people make of those disruptions and the social processes those appraisals set in motion. Such a situation can be called an `extreme environment', in which the disruption between communities and the physical environment narrows the range of what people know about their physical world while simultaneously intensifying their need to protect themselves by acting on that world with imperfect knowledge.  All the articles in this issue deal in one way or another with this type of extreme environment and its social impacts. The first looks at long-term environmental disruptions as a new type of disaster. The next three examine the relationship between risk and social policy. The development of grassroots and environmental justice movements is the focus of the next two articles. The final two contributions discuss the attempts to understand the nature and impacts of technologically induced extreme environments.",sociology

For over three decades, his concepts have helped to generate both empirical and theoretical interventions in the field of study. His impact on the sociology of music taste, in particular, has been profound, his ideas directly informing our understandings of how musical preferences reflect and reproduce inequalities between social classes. But, recently his legacy has been under question and newer approaches to the music/society problematic have emerged. These have made important claims about the nature of the sociological enterprise when confronted with the specificity of cultural works, as well as how social change impacts on our relations with musical forms. This paper takes stock of the impact of Bourdieu’s ideas on the sociology of music, the debates sparked in their wake and the attempt at something like a “post‐Bourdieusian” sociology more faithful to music’s material properties. It will ask to what extent Bourdieu’s claims about social stratification and music consumption are still relevant and whether they are sophisticated enough to deal with the specific ways that we interact with musical forms.",sociology

In contradistinction to this standard view, which in current debates receives the name of methodological nationalism, I advance a re-interpretation of classical sociology's conceptualization of the nation-state that points towards what can be called the opacity of its position in modernity. Marx understood the historical elusiveness of the nation-state as he believed that it had already passed its heyday as political struggles were fought between Empires and the Commune. Weber captured the sociological equivocations that arose from the historical disjuncture between the nation and the state. And Durkheim, finally, tried to come to terms with the nation-state's normative ambiguity via the immanent tension between nationalism and cosmopolitanism. The conclusion is that, even if not thoroughly unproblematic, classical sociologists were able to avoid the reification of the nation-state's position in modernity precisely because they were not obsessed with conceptualizing modernity as such from the viewpoint of the nation-state.",sociology

While literature in this field has tended towards macro-institutionalist analysis, recent research has re-articulated post-nationalism as micro-level practice. This article builds on this development by attending to the ‘affective conditions’ of such micro-political practices. The article draws on research into protests in Brisbane in February 2016 to prevent ‘Asha’, a child seeking asylum, from being returned to offshore detention. The analysis of this case demonstrates that affect performs a dual function in the practice of post-nationalism, to catalyse action in solidarity with the noncitizen informed primarily by the emotional resonance of a particular rendering of vulnerability, and in re-imagined solidarity with the co-citizen around a post-national community of feeling. Informed by this analysis, the article highlights the complex and fragile nature of a post-national solidarity dependent on intersecting, overlapping and at times problematic, affective conditions.",sociology

Drawing on the sociology of knowledge, the article argues that Weber’s perspective is untenable conceptually and practically. Strong reflexivity, here illustrated through Standpoint Feminism and Bourdieusian sociology, permits a coherent delineation of the problem of the scholarly vocation, in a way that reconciles the social origins, efficacy and responsibility of science, and hence allows for a more realist reformulation of the cognitive, social and moral dilemmas we face as scholars, educators, and citizens.",sociology

The author endeavors to show that four difficulties can be successfully overcome. (1) The first is epistemological in nature. Human rights are often presented as legal norms. By relying on the Putman/Habermas debate, the author maintains that Sen’s epistemology is Putnamian, allowing us to treat human rights a system of values (rather than as a system of norms), thereby enabling the construction of a system of evaluation (the “goal rights system”) that is neither consequentialist nor deontological. This system is open to public deliberation and can thus take into account the systems of evaluation of participants (in addition to that of the observer). This epistemological basis serves to remove the other obstacles. (2) By defining the individual in terms of “capabilities”, Sen avoids a methodological individualism that would produce an under-socialized version of the individual. (3) He includes social, economic, and cultural rights in the list of human rights, whereas liberal philosophies tend to exclude these. (4) He allows for the thematization of the specific conversion factors that condition the transformation of formal rights into real freedoms (internormative culture, civilian legal intermediaries, access to resources and the capabilities to use them). Avoiding formalism, the capability approach is a valuable instrument for a critical sociology of human rights.",sociology

What are the characteristics of the theoretical environment, in which cultural sociology is operating? The article begins by reviewing the literature on interdisciplinarity. Many authors argue that interdisciplinarity is increasing or should be increasing, but the general consensus is that disciplinary isolation is the norm. From this perspective, the relationships between disciplines can be understood in terms of <jats:italic>trading zones</jats:italic>, in which fields in different disciplines have little in common, theoretically, or empirically. Interdisciplinary communication in ‘trading zones’ requires that participants laboriously construct a set of terms that permits them to exchange ideas. Alternatively, I propose that clusters of fields in different disciplines are linked by <jats:italic>free‐floating paradigms</jats:italic>. Participants in disciplines that share ‘free‐floating paradigms’ are able to communicate with one another more readily. The article presents evidence for the second interpretation, drawn from survey articles in disciplinary handbooks. Disciplines and fields in which the study of culture draws from the same pool of paradigms and models and shares a set of lines of inquiry with cultural sociology include traditional disciplines, such as anthropology, communication, geography, history and psychology, and interdisciplinary fields, such as cultural studies, communication, feminist theory, material culture, science studies, and visual culture. Interdisciplinary fields – particularly cultural studies – perform an important role in diffusing paradigms across disciplinary boundaries. Free‐floating paradigms are associated with the work of major theorists, such as Lévi‐Strauss, Barthes, Foucault, Bourdieu, Lyotard, Baudrillard, Clifford Geertz, Bruno Latour, Adorno, Gramsci, and Habermas.",sociology

Rather, trust has been studied within limited sets of exchange or work relations. This article revisits Simmel’s concept of trust as social form in order to investigate this differentiation. From an interview study, the differentiation and limits of trust are analysed within different types of social relations. Trust is found to vary greatly in scope and mode influenced by the intersecting dimensions of relations, objects and situations. Furthermore, trust exists between an outer threshold of expected deceit and an inner threshold of confident reliance.

The essay explores how these viewpoints intersected with the implementation of economic reforms by the Gorbachev regime, arguing that the dominant forces within Soviet sociology ultimately helped the party-state bureaucracy craft the legitimizing ideology of perestroika by insisting that growing social inequality and market-based mechanisms of distribution were the very embodiment of socialism. After enduring a politically fraught and semi-pariah existence for much of its history, Soviet sociology enjoyed a belle epoque as it helped the ruling elite navigate the transition to capitalism.",sociology

The main question that was considered to be of real sociological interest concerned the transformation of ‘little savages’ into civilized, reliable social actors, into adult actors, namely socialization. In contrast, the new sociological view of children fosters the study of a variety of children’s issues, addressing questions which are overlooked, excluded, marginalized or rendered illegitimate by the focus on socialization. Some important starting points and the central concepts of the ‘new’ childhood sociology — as it is often characterized by its proponents — are outlined. The development and ‘state of the art’ of this sociological field in different countries needs to be compared and reflected against the background of everyday assumptions and social problems in each of the respective societies in order to foster the further production of sociologically relevant knowledge — this constituted the programmatic approach of the articles assembled here.",sociology

Sociologists working to illuminate the causes and contours of these inequities often center the role of family foodwork, or the multifaceted domestic labor that supports eating, including planning and preparing meals. Mounting sociological scholarship on foodwork considers how food's meanings are socially patterned to reflect broader social structures, ideologies and institutions that influence their manifestation and families' resources to enact them. Here, we present three core contributions from the sociology of foodwork that can advance essential transdisciplinary conversations around nutrition disparities as well as efforts to tackle these disparities. We lay out how (1) family foodwork is historically rooted in broader structures of capitalist exploitation and women's subordination, and today remains gendered through normative discourses equating “good” feeding with “good” mothering; (2) the moralization of foodwork is buttressed by an ideological context idealizing homecooked meals and lamenting foodwork's decline, and; (3) foodwork—and societal evaluations of it—are shaped and stratified by intersecting gendered, classed, and racial inequalities. After reviewing each contribution and its importance for addressing nutrition inequities, we conclude by advocating for a closer conversation across disciplines and highlighting important future directions for sociologists.",sociology

Results suggest that trust in the family physicians is built through personal experiences with them which can be easily adjusted in contrast with overall trust in the healthcare system.

As there is no doubt that only a substantial cultural change could counteract the trend, the article deals with that part of the western epistemic community that embodies the highest cultural capital, namely learned professions, by asking what theoretical and practical limits are they reaching? Are they accountable for the ongoing general situation? Are their knowledge, commitment and performance socially adequate? If not, do professional work, action and trustworthiness require new analytical, social and moral foundations? A plausible answer to these questions seems to be offered by the abandonment of traditionally dominant formal-rational methodology, a return to the concept of substantive rationality and the appraisal of the multidisciplinary advancements provided by sociology of science. In this respect, the analysis stresses the limits of dominant sociological approaches to professions, by centring on the notion of status-role and by enlightening the pivotal importance of the indeterminacy of knowledge as primary professional traits of professionalism. Consequently, it suggests the need for a radical theoretical revision of common views about sources, forms and degrees of socioprofessional reliability, trustworthiness and confidence, given the fact that such a revision is anyhow required in practice by the new trajectories of the profession power–knowledge nexus in the age of the risk–knowledge society.",sociology

I argue that such a structural lens is essential to our understanding of the meso (institutional and disciplinary) levels of teaching sociology. I argue a nascent ‘teaching and learning movement’ in Irish sociology may be emerging. A number of factors that have facilitated this are identified. However even a quick glance at Irish higher education also reveals contradictions and conflicts which threaten this movement before it is even established, including worsening staff-student ratios, increased casualisation of teaching and the neo-liberal turn. The paper concludes with a call for more sociologically informed work both on teaching and learning in Irish higher education, and on teaching sociology.

However, unlike some other activist-oriented perspectives or standpoints, it is neither antistate nor antinational but is guided by a sense of inclusive unity or the common good. Essential to this unity is “recognition” and institutional, not merely symbolic, accommodation of minorities and a perspective on the “multi” which goes beyond the black-white binary and a secularist exclusion of political claims-making by religious and ethnoreligious groups such as Muslims in western Europe. Critically, the Bristol School of Multiculturalism is not just normative in that it does normative sociology, but most importantly, it engages in political theory to justify its normative perspective against objections and rival normative positions. So, the Bristol School of Multiculturalism is perhaps not just a normative sociology but also a form of normative sociological theory.",sociology

We use data from a probabilistic national representative survey among Romanian adults 18 years old or older (n = 2115) fielded in 2019. Binary logistic regression modeling shows that probability of vaccinating against seasonal influenza is higher when the participants trust the overall healthcare system [Odds Ratio = 1.36,

In this essay, we survey contemporary empirical research on cultural tastes and use retroductive reasoning from measurements of taste to clarify the semantic ambiguity surrounding taste. We argue that taste should be conceptualized as a person’s thick subjectivity in a cultural field, that is to say a fundamentally multidimensional orientation that describes how we feel, consume, and praise in cultural fields. Recognizing the inherent multidimensionality to taste allows us to refine our understanding of complex taste phenomena. We outline a family of complex tastes using characteristic antinomies among their constituent modalities of action, and use a case study to show how each variety corresponds to extant folk concepts about taste.",sociology

The general heading of the sociology of work subsumes many topics, which can be separated roughly into individual‐level approaches and structural‐level approaches. Individual‐level approaches treat the individual as the unit of analysis and typically focus on ascribed characteristics such as gender, race, and age. They also commonly address achieved characteristics such as education, promotion, compensation, and other labor force outcomes.

Traditionally, for instance, theories in fields such as psychology and sociology were strong in intuitive content, but weak from a formal point of view.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0220,"<p>One of the most pressing challenges of single-parent families is the concern for their socioeconomic well-being. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than two-parent families, and there is growing concern about the rising inequality among family types. Much research has focused on how children fare in single-parent families and whether or not they are at a disadvantage. However, concerns are not limited to children living in single-parent families, but also to single parents themselves. Single parenthood is strongly gendered: single parents are mostly mothers, and they therefore experience unequal opportunities and gender discrimination in the labor market. This bibliography addresses the key issues and debates related to single-parent families. Rather than promoting a single argument, it introduces the reader to a number of different perspectives, without taking a position on one perspective over the other. As the single-parent literature is broad and expanding rapidly, it is difficult to cover all aspects of single parenthood. Instead, this bibliography focuses on single-parent families in context. It covers how individual characteristics of single parents, such as their resources and education, shape aspects of their well-being. Yet the main focus is on how their well-being is also shaped by their socioeconomic and institutional context. How do employment and policy affect the lives of single parents and their children? The bibliography uses a comparative focus to examine the research on single-parent families across countries. Hence, it does not include all publications that address single parenthood, such as the social psychological aspects, but rather it examines the literature that best captures how single parents are doing in the context of the institutions and policies that surround them. This bibliography on “Single Parents in Context” is structured in six major sections. First, a broad overview of the literature is provided in the section on General Contributions This covers what can be considered Classics in the literature, and prior Research Overviews. The second section deals with aspects of the Socioeconomic Well-Being of single parents and their families, including Poverty, Child Well-Being, and Stigma. The next major sections (a substantial part of the bibliography) cover explanations for the often impaired well-being among single-parent families. These sections include resource-based, employment-based, and policy-based explanations. Resource-Based Explanations focus on individual characteristics of the single parents themselves, and include the debate regarding the important Diverging Destinies and Life-Course Perspective. Diverging Destinies suggests that single-parent families are increasingly common among those with lower socioeconomic resources, such as education. Life-Course Perspective discusses the dynamic process of single parenthood over the life course, such as transitions into and out of single parenthood. Employment-Based Explanations examine to what extent, and under which conditions, a job can be a means to improve single parents’ well-being. Employment is indeed important, because in some contexts single parents are employed but remain in poverty—considered the Working Poor. Additionally, single parents face particular challenges in terms of Work-Life Balance and negotiating the demands of work and family. Most importantly, this bibliography covers a wide range of policies and emphasizes various Policy-Based Explanations. Family Policy facilitates maternal employment and, increasingly, paternal care, as well as providing financial transfers to families with children. Active Labor Market Policy represents those policies that are often in the form of services, such as job placement and training. Such policy seeks to facilitate the employment of the inactive and unemployed. Redistributive Policy typically provides income transfers to help families financially sustain themselves. This is support from the social safety net in the form of cash assistance such as housing, food, and child benefit. Naturally, there is overlap between policy types, but family policy for families with children warrants a specific focus. There is also a focus on Child Support, which is a set of policies that regulates financial transfers among households of separated parents. This is followed by Policy Debates, a discussion that emphasizes the key debates around the design and implementation of policy for single-parent families. The final major section, Research Frontiers, lays out the frontiers in single-parent research. It highlights the potential major challenges and opportunities for research in years to come. These areas include Shared Parenting, Methodological Innovations, and Global Perspectives on what works for single parents and their families.</p>",sociology

This line of argument ushered the rising consensus across the social sciences that the prime causal role belongs to institutions. However, the empirical literature that has followed from this consensus has been marred by a lack of proper definition of the concept and a tendency to use nations as units of analysis, neglecting their internal complexity.

The study shows the feasibility of studying institutions empirically and highlights a series of important differences among then and across countries.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0257,"<p>Ethnic enclaves have been defined in numerous ways. The word “ethnic” is often used to refer to a particular group with a shared nationality or cultural background. Enclaves sometimes refer to the concentration of ethnic groups within a geographic area. Academic inquiry of ethnic enclaves began with Kenneth Wilson and Alejandro Portes’s study of the “immigrant enclave” formed by Cubans in Miami, which they define as a concentration of ethnic businesses employing people from the same ethnic group. Researchers have tested, expanded, and modified the “enclave hypothesis”—ethnic concentration having a protective effect against a generally hostile climate facing immigrants and ethnic minorities. Depending on the author an enclave may refer to the geographic concentration of migrants and coethnics in a neighborhood; a place with social and economic structures that diverge from those in the surrounding area; or a concentration of economic activity, particularly businesses owned and staffed by members of a single ethnic group. In the strictest sense, ethnic enclaves are made up of a high concentration of an ethnic group within a geographic space, including a large number of business owners from that community. There have been examples throughout US history of ethnic enclaves, including Cubans in Miami, New York’s Chinatown, Japanese and Korean enclaves in California, and Jewish communities in Manhattan. There are also immigrant enclaves across the world. The protective effects of enclaves are largely related to the concentration of economic power to support social, cultural, and political development for immigrant communities committed to sustaining community life within the country where an enclave is formed. Many researchers have used a partial definition of ethnic enclaves only in terms of residential concentration. From this point of view, the existing evidence shows mixed effects for living in an enclave depending on the context, aspects of the enclave studied, and relative outcomes of interest. When applied and compared, the similarities between enclaves and other community formations, such as barrios and ghettos, become relevant. Segregation most frequently serves dominant groups who use isolation to disproportionately apportion resources and exploit marginalized workers. Yet, as Cathy Yang Liu has shown, a concentration of opportunities can lead to strong social and cultural networks within ethnic enclaves. Researchers using the concept of ethnic enclaves can benefit from considering the multilayered factors of immigration, ethnic difference, urban environments, economic systems, health, and power differentials between and among residents in ethnic enclave communities and beyond.</p>",sociology

10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosf081,"“Figurational” sociology is the term used for the research tradition stemming from the work of Norbert Elias (1897–1990). The name comes from Elias's use of the grounding concept of “figuration” as a deliberate attempt to bypass and reformulate the speech and thought parameters of what he saw as homo clausus (“closed person”) assumptions underlying much of sociology. Figurational sociologists reject such common notions as agency–structure, action–structure, or “individual” and “society,” all of which imply that “the individual” is something separate and isolated from “society.” They think instead in terms of figurations or complex webs of interdependent relationships between people (homines aperti, or “open people”). These complex webs of interdependence are always in a state of flux, hence the alternative title of “process sociology” preferred by many researchers working within this tradition. Figurational dynamics can be seen in the longer and shorter term and might include state formation processes, civilizing and decivilizing processes, or the deamateurization of sport amongst many others.",sociology

As is the case with many disciplines, it is contested and there is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes sociology. As a social science, sociology can be described as evidence‐based social inquiry into the social world and informed by conceptual frameworks and established methodological approaches. Sociology is the only science specifically devoted to the study of society in the broad sense of the term, meaning the social world and the open field of the social. Like many of the social and human sciences it does not have a clearly defined subject matter. Sociology is a versatile and resilient discipline that takes many forms. One of its enduring characteristics is that it brings to bear on the study of the social world a general perspective born of the recognition that the sum is greater than the parts.",sociology

Still, old habits die hard. Focusing on selected texts in the sociology of the Australian family, this paper traces the effects of failing to focus the sociological gaze on subjectivity and its variation across society. Highlighted are some patterns of analytic misconstruction of subjectivity, especially the substitution of measurement for a theory of practice, and the projection by sociologists of their own class‐specific subjectivity onto society at large. Ultimately, this misconstruction turns works like those discussed in this paper into a powerful denial of alternative subjectivities, and a reinforcement of the socially dominant perspective.",sociology

The fact that these changes occurred in many western countries but led to legalisation in only a few makes this claim problematic. I examine whether socio‐legal propositions, with respect to the emergence of laws which focus on social control, offer a better approach to understanding the development of rules allowing and governing euthanasia. After a short sketch of the history of the Dutch law regulating euthanasia, I discuss these three societal changes in the light of shifts in the social control of medical behaviour that shortens life. I show that the Dutch relaxation of the prohibition of euthanasia goes together with new forms of social control: doctors’ self control is complemented with second‐party control (by patients), professional third‐party control and governmental control. My work calls attention to the fact that bioethics is part of larger systems of social control.",sociology

Success in reality competitions is often achieved through the development of alliances and strategic relationships and the process by which these unions form can be sociologically fascinating to watch. Yet, sociology, in method and theory, has rarely been applied to the analysis of reality television. This is not to say that reality television has not been examined academically. In fact, there is a growing body of research, primarily conducted by communication studies scholars, that takes this type of television seriously.

The main academic interests of Japanese sociology of education have been educational choice and socialization in secondary education, topics also discussed in Durkheim’s masterwork, L’Évolution pédagogique en France. The interests of Japanese researchers in the sociology of education were aroused because of drastic changes in the youth labor market in the mid-1990s and national curriculum reforms influenced by international educational evaluation, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment, in the 2000s.

Because the development of curricula is and should be a social process, we argue that students’ perceptions of learning outcomes also should be considered when curricula are developed. This study utilizes a content analysis of 461 student-authored, end-of-semester reflective essays concerning the most memorable learning that occurred in an introductory sociology course.

10.1177/17499755211048435,"This article offers a regional spotlight introduction to Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology. The question of what makes Canada unique has long preoccupied Canadian writers, artists, and policy makers, and is central to scholarly debates about Canadian sociology’s position relative to British, American, and other national sociologies, as well as the need for decolonization and diversification of the disciplinary canon. As a subfield, Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology receives little attention within these wider debates despite its emphasis on issues of cultural difference, identity, and evaluation. We provide an analysis of the dynamics of the field. Using course syllabi and survey data from instructors (N = 28), we examine whether there is a unique canon in Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology, and how cultural sociology is taught across Canada. Network analysis of texts assigned on syllabi and survey responses from cultural sociology instructors reveal, first, a thematic canon in Canadian cultural sociology, with a plurality of authors used to teach four main themes: identity and representation, cultural production, cultural consumption, and conceptualizing and measuring culture. Second, we find the positionality of Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology (with respect to both other national sociologies and neighboring subfields/disciplines) is uncertain and widely variant. Finally, survey responses concerning identity and representation suggest a reflexivity about the politics of canonization, and a gendered interest in decolonizing curricula. We conclude by arguing that a thematic canon in cultural sociology facilitates the maintenance of fuzzy boundaries with other subfields, national and Indigenous intellectual traditions, and a critical feminist lens.",sociology

First, the rise in food allergies is placed within the field of the social history and medicalization of allergies, and seeks to understand the phenomenon in the context of the industrialized modern world. The following section discusses how and why lay experts are increasingly dominating the food allergy-related discourse. Drawing on recent empirical data, it is further shown how food allergies rise along with a population’s affluence and education. Third, the idiosyncrasies of food allergies and intolerances are addressed with respect to food consumption and its changing social implications. It is argued that individualization places less pressure on individuals to conform to broader social norms of food refusal, which offers the sufferers with a newly acquired sense of control over a random, scientified, and confounding food availability and provides a medium to covertly convey their educational and socioeconomic background. Lastly, the health belief model is applied in order to suggest a further potential explanation for the current increase in self-reported food allergies and intolerances.",sociology

Holmwood is correct that sociology is vulnerable to external pressures to demonstrate its relevance to social practice, but those pressures come from left‐wing social movements as well as from centres of power. He is also correct that external pressures contribute to internal disagreement, but sociology has been at war with itself since the 1960s, with little evident decline in its academic standing or intellectual vitality.

Within sociology, such a rational choice model is regarded as a major theoretical or/and methodological innovation and thus a `new' promise for sociology's unification.

However, his use of aggregate supply and demand curves requires, first, that what is being exchanged should be additive; second, that actors should evaluate exchanges by universalistic criteria; and, third, that they should act atomistically. The third assumption seems implausible within a work group, but, if it is valid, it follows that predictions cannot be made about status.

The author considers literary sources related to the scientific work of M. Castells, methodological tools of discursive analysis and databases. The paper describes theoretical approaches to the study of the concept of the power of communication in ontological and socio-cultural contexts, as well as the characteristics of the author’s empirical sociological research in the framework of disclosing the logical and semantic components of the concept under consideration. Based on the discursive analysis, the author reveals structural, functional, procedural, organizational and managerial components of the theoretical views of the scientist, which help to clarify the object-subject sphere and the methodological arsenal of sociological research in the field of information and communication network “Internet”. The article considers the scientific approaches of the scientist to clarify the concept of “power” by explaining the role and place of actors in it, as well as use by them of social networks for their influence. The author highlights separately the scientist`s disclosure of the “network society” concept, which determines the network structure of connections based on the activation of information. The paper describes the features of the scientific method of M. Castells, associated with the postulation of the thesis of the regularity of the continuous replacement of scientific concepts in the knowledge of power relations and communications, the importance of flexibility and changing the angle of view of the scientist to solve specific research problems.

Thus the literary field can be described as a horizontally differentiated system that is, however, vertically differentiated internally.  The concern of the paper is to test Bourdieu's theoretical considerations empirically. Data for the analysis and interpretation are based on interviews of Cologne writers. The data are analysed with the aid of blockmodel and correspondence analysis. As far as the data allows us to operationalise the thesis that the literary field is an autonomous differentiated system, Bourdieu's thesis is confirmed. The internal structure can be described more precisely: the first line of demarcation is, in fact, the difference that Bourdieu described between legitimate and illegitimate art: high-culture literature and low-culture literature are the two poles of the literary field. The realm of the legitimate literature is further differentiated into three blocks (elite, junior elite, periphery). The elite and the periphery differ in terms of the different degrees of success. The junior elite occupies an intermediate place. Bourdieu's sociology of literature is supported by the empirical material at hand.",sociology

By contrast, this paper shows the imperial and hence global aspects of early American sociological thought. Early American sociologists were interested in imperialism and, therefore, in cross-societal, transnational, and global processes and relations. Implicitly or explicitly they approached imperialism as a process by which social groups, not least ‘races,’ interacted and conflicted. They also saw it as a route towards new global forms.

To track trends in sectoral sociology, scientists turn to scientometric methods, but they are not enough. Trends in the development of the sociology of values as a branch of sociology are the subject of the study. The purpose of the work is an assessment of the possibilities of using natural language analysis methods (NLP/NLA) for thematic and theoretical clustering of research in the sociology of values. The design of the study was quantitative and qualitative, it was carried out in two stages. At the first stage, 121 abstracts of a scientific articles were analyzed using text mining, after which their total array was divided into clusters. At the second stage, the results of machine clustering were examined by the method of qualitative text analysis, on the basis of which the limitations and capabilities of the NLP/NLA method were identified for solving the problem of clustering scientific texts. It was found that articles with a more conservative core of theoretical categories (gender studies, migration studies, the theory of globalism) are more amenable to clustering, while theories with a loosely structured and fluid theoretical core (theories using environmental terminology, theories of inequality) are much less amenable to explicit clustering. The results obtained allow us to form a new direction of work with large arrays of scientific texts, associated with their clustering using NLP/NLA. Building clusters enables researchers to work with all texts in a given subject area, and not just with the most cited ones.

Drawing from a diverse range of scholarship since Saul Feldman called for a “sociology of stature” in the 1970s, I then present ways in which height and height differences have figured in various domains of human experience, from employment and education to sports and social relationships. Finally, I survey people's attempts to become taller or shorter, and the implicit values that inform such height‐making practices. What these figurations and practices show, I argue, is that height intersects with notions of race, class, gender, and beauty – but is irreducible to any of them, and is thus best viewed as a distinct, embodied form of distinction, difference, and inequality.

These three debates help us clarify some key theses in our long-term understanding of nations and nationalism: processes of nation and nation-state formation are not opposed to but compatible with the rise of globalisation and non-state forms of governance; the question ‘when is a nation?’ combines modern and pre-modern dimensions; the politics of nationalism is neither unfailingly democratic nor exclusively regressive.

Yet Heidegger’s existentialism renders our finitude – not just death – a matter of everyday life, a constitutive feature of human existence and a source of sociological investigation. By explicating Heidegger’s interconnected concepts of finitude, futurity, authenticity and resoluteness, we propose to investigate people’s ordinary temporal experiences as well as the institutional contexts that make them possible.

10.1177/1468795x12453271,"This article presents a critical analysis of a recurring interpretation of Émile Durkheim’s sociology, namely that it views society as fixed in a rigid, instituted form, doomed to self-repetition, and impervious to any type of change except that of its own necessary internal development (see the work of Albert Bayet, Georges Sorel, Georges Gurvitch, Talcott Parsons, Robert Nisbet, or Raymond Boudon). It is argued here that this reproductive interpretation is based on Chapter 3 of The Rules of Sociological Method (1895), but that Durkheim himself rejected it altogether in his later writings. From his 1898 article, ‘Individual and Collective Representations,’ to The Elementary Forms of Religious Life of 1912, Durkheim came to see one activity of society – the transformative activity of collective ideation – as unconcerned with the satisfaction of purely morphological needs. The point, however, is not that Durkheim’s sociology developed from a morphological approach governed by a principle of self-reproducibility to a psychological approach that transcends the production/reproduction dichotomy. The article argues instead that by neglecting the contribution of the discipline of sociology, and of the epistemological principles on which it is based, to the instituting activity of collective ideation, the reproductive interpretation offers only a partial reading of The Rules of Sociological Method: sociology, as a scientific form of collective ideation, actually instantiates its transformative, even subversive, force.",sociology

               This introductory chapter is intended to provide the reader with an overview of the ways that sociology has engaged in the topics of gender and sexuality, and how Indigenous sociological perspectives can broaden the Western sociological gaze. Specific attention is paid to how White heteronormative patriarchy supported colonial violence on Indigenous women, Two-Spirit peoples, as well as Indigenous men. Prior to colonization, Indigenous notions of gender and sexuality were not relegated to Western binaries of male/female. Rather, Indigenous understandings were pluralized, where fluidity of genders and sexualities were understood to be normal. The chapters in this section focus on the complexities of Indigenous genders and sexualities, how colonial violence has impacted Indigenous lifeworlds, and that it is through an Indigenous gendered and queer approach that decolonization can occur.",sociology

These tensions between Aron and Hayek are analysed by assessing Aron’s involvement in the Mont Pèlerin Society and the Congress for Cultural Freedom through the 1950s, and then considering the arguments of his 1962 review of Hayek’s Constitution of Liberty and his 1963 Jefferson Lectures. While Aron has been largely neglected in the existing literature on neoliberalism, it will be argued that he was the key sociological figure to engage critically with neoliberalism in its formative years and, beyond this, that the value of his work today lies in its defence of the social basis of democracy and freedom against the raw economism of neoliberal thought.",sociology

I discuss several main approaches taken by social scientists to explain the relationship between spatial and political divides in the United States, including those that focus on shifting political geographies, cultural factors, economic anxiety, and racial resentment. Then, pointing to several recent exemplars, I identify theoretical, methodological, and perspectival strengths that the discipline of rural sociology can and should engage in developing explanatory frameworks for better understanding these social and spatial shifts – shifts that are simultaneously crises of democracy and crises of epistemology.",sociology

Work on the history of sociology is not usually approached through the study of its institutions, but this chapter argues that they deserve much more attention than they have received. The British Sociological Association has not been merely a mirror or consequence of what was happening elsewhere; it has also been a motor of change and development which has had consequences for the history (as well as being of interest as an institution in its own right). This chapter reviews some of the ways in which the British Sociological Association has played a part in the more general history of sociology, in support of the argument for the value of more work on sociological institutions, leading into a more general discussion of lacunae in what has so far been treated and of some of the problems facing historical work in this field.</p>",sociology

Working under conditions of `inner exile' in Nazi Germany, Alfred Weber composed a series of writings dating from the years of the Second World War on conceptions of transcendence in Western civilization and their relevance to a sociological revaluation of the time-honoured claims of Judaeo-Christian monotheism. These writings compare closely with Karl Jaspers's existentialist conception of transcendence and `limit-experience' from the same period and also particularly with the later philosophical writings of Georg Simmel on the concept of life and the meaning of absolute value orientations from the standpoint of historical immanence. This distinctive conception of `immanent transcendence' — first named as such by Simmel and later reaffirmed by Alfred Weber — is explored in this article in relation to a range of questions about the normative import of theological figures of thought and language for the formation of modern social-scientific thinking and reasoning. The claim is defended that Alfred Weber's oeuvre should remain of interest to contemporary social theorists, despite its many weaknesses and frequent moments of obscurity.",sociology

Upon closer examination, it is apparent that Durkheim and the Chicago school share a great deal more points of connection than are commonly acknowledged. These similarities have been blurred due to (1) a lack of distinction between the later, qualitatively focused Chicago school of sociology researchers with the more quantitatively-based work of the original school and (2) a pervasive misunderstanding of what Durkheim meant by treating a ‘social fact’ as a thing. A more accurate account reveals that the two research traditions are both heavily empirical, pragmatic, contextually based approaches to studying non-individualized, collective behavior. These points of convergence show that the Chicago school of sociology, and American sociology in general, constructed many of the same solutions to similar theoretical problems as did Durkheim.",sociology

It indicates the intellectual influences of the early years that Bourdieu subsequently acknowledged and then examines his use of the work of Weber in his first book, Sociologie de l’Algérie (1958). The paper then focuses on the development of Bourdieu’s thought from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, a period in which he strategically presented himself as an anti-humanist sociologist whilst also articulating a view of science that was in tune with phenomenological and ontological philosophy. Bourdieu’s ‘Sociology and Philosophy in France since 1945’ (1967a) receives particular attention since his analysis of sociology and philosophy in France in the post-war period was a key element in his own position-taking in respect of the two disciplines. The paper then examines Bourdieu’s critiques of Weber at this time and suggests that his dissatisfaction with Weber’s epistemology logically became a dissastisfaction with the claims of sociological explanation as such. There followed an attempt to reconcile a commitment to social science with an allegiance to elements of phenomenological thought. The outcome was a willingness on Bourdieu’s part to see reflexivity as a means to problematiz- ing sociological explanation more than as a means to refining it or making it more sophisticated. The consequence was that commitments to phenomenological ontology and social science co-existed in this period. The balance was to change again subsequently in Bourdieu’s thought, and his responsivenesss to changing conditions exemplifies how we should ourselves rethink the relations between possible future social theories and the classical theories of Western sociology.",sociology

Highlighted are some patterns of analytic misconstruction of subjectivity, especially the substitution of measurement for a theory of practice, and the projection by sociologists of their own class‐specific subjectivity onto society at large. Ultimately, this misconstruction turns works like those discussed in this paper into a powerful denial of alternative subjectivities, and a reinforcement of the socially dominant perspective.",sociology

I examine whether socio‐legal propositions, with respect to the emergence of laws which focus on social control, offer a better approach to understanding the development of rules allowing and governing euthanasia. After a short sketch of the history of the Dutch law regulating euthanasia, I discuss these three societal changes in the light of shifts in the social control of medical behaviour that shortens life. I show that the Dutch relaxation of the prohibition of euthanasia goes together with new forms of social control: doctors’ self control is complemented with second‐party control (by patients), professional third‐party control and governmental control.

The author considers literary sources related to the scientific work of M. Castells, methodological tools of discursive analysis and databases. The paper describes theoretical approaches to the study of the concept of the power of communication in ontological and socio-cultural contexts, as well as the characteristics of the author’s empirical sociological research in the framework of disclosing the logical and semantic components of the concept under consideration. Based on the discursive analysis, the author reveals structural, functional, procedural, organizational and managerial components of the theoretical views of the scientist, which help to clarify the object-subject sphere and the methodological arsenal of sociological research in the field of information and communication network “Internet”. The article considers the scientific approaches of the scientist to clarify the concept of “power” by explaining the role and place of actors in it, as well as use by them of social networks for their influence. The author highlights separately the scientist`s disclosure of the “network society” concept, which determines the network structure of connections based on the activation of information. The paper describes the features of the scientific method of M. Castells, associated with the postulation of the thesis of the regularity of the continuous replacement of scientific concepts in the knowledge of power relations and communications, the importance of flexibility and changing the angle of view of the scientist to solve specific research problems. The author emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the scientific methodology, method and socio-project approaches of the scientist.

Art in general, and the literary field in particular, is interpreted as a differentiated social field that is autonomous in the sense that it follows its own logic - the competition for cultural legitimation. What literature has in common with other social systems is the stratification of its internal structure into a hierarchical arrangement. Thus the literary field can be described as a horizontally differentiated system that is, however, vertically differentiated internally.  The concern of the paper is to test Bourdieu's theoretical considerations empirically. Data for the analysis and interpretation are based on interviews of Cologne writers. The data are analysed with the aid of blockmodel and correspondence analysis. As far as the data allows us to operationalise the thesis that the literary field is an autonomous differentiated system, Bourdieu's thesis is confirmed. The internal structure can be described more precisely: the first line of demarcation is, in fact, the difference that Bourdieu described between legitimate and illegitimate art: high-culture literature and low-culture literature are the two poles of the literary field. The realm of the legitimate literature is further differentiated into three blocks (elite, junior elite, periphery). The elite and the periphery differ in terms of the different degrees of success.

Indeed, a reading of Weber's later writings through the prism of the inaugural lecture provides new, challenging and corrective understandings of Weber's argument and meaning. In a discussion of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and Weber's methodological essays, two things are shown.

By contrast, this paper shows the imperial and hence global aspects of early American sociological thought. Early American sociologists were interested in imperialism and, therefore, in cross-societal, transnational, and global processes and relations. Implicitly or explicitly they approached imperialism as a process by which social groups, not least ‘races,’ interacted and conflicted. They also saw it as a route towards new global forms.

The main academic interests of Japanese sociology of education have been educational choice and socialization in secondary education, topics also discussed in Durkheim’s masterwork, L’Évolution pédagogique en France. The interests of Japanese researchers in the sociology of education were aroused because of drastic changes in the youth labor market in the mid-1990s and national curriculum reforms influenced by international educational evaluation, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment, in the 2000s. Though the number of empirical studies has increased substantially over the past two decades, this field must make efforts to develop its theoretical sophistication in order to connect to worldwide research on sociology of education.",sociology

Because the development of curricula is and should be a social process, we argue that students’ perceptions of learning outcomes also should be considered when curricula are developed. This study utilizes a content analysis of 461 student-authored, end-of-semester reflective essays concerning the most memorable learning that occurred in an introductory sociology course. Collected between 2006 and 2015, the assignment was utilized in each of 12 introductory sociology course sections taught by the same instructor at two universities. We then map student essay topics onto the Sociological Literacy Framework (SLF) to identify the themes most memorable to students, comparing responses of online, regional campus students with residential campus students. Results suggest the instructor placed the greatest emphasis on the SLF Sociological Eye theme and the least emphasis on the SLF Social Change and Reproduction theme. Students found topics within the SLF Socialization theme most memorable and rarely cited the SLF Social Change and Reproduction theme.",sociology

10.1177/17499755211048435,"This article offers a regional spotlight introduction to Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology. The question of what makes Canada unique has long preoccupied Canadian writers, artists, and policy makers, and is central to scholarly debates about Canadian sociology’s position relative to British, American, and other national sociologies, as well as the need for decolonization and diversification of the disciplinary canon. As a subfield, Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology receives little attention within these wider debates despite its emphasis on issues of cultural difference, identity, and evaluation. We provide an analysis of the dynamics of the field. Using course syllabi and survey data from instructors (N = 28), we examine whether there is a unique canon in Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology, and how cultural sociology is taught across Canada. Network analysis of texts assigned on syllabi and survey responses from cultural sociology instructors reveal, first, a thematic canon in Canadian cultural sociology, with a plurality of authors used to teach four main themes: identity and representation, cultural production, cultural consumption, and conceptualizing and measuring culture. Second, we find the positionality of Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology (with respect to both other national sociologies and neighboring subfields/disciplines) is uncertain and widely variant. Finally, survey responses concerning identity and representation suggest a reflexivity about the politics of canonization, and a gendered interest in decolonizing curricula. We conclude by arguing that a thematic canon in cultural sociology facilitates the maintenance of fuzzy boundaries with other subfields, national and Indigenous intellectual traditions, and a critical feminist lens.",sociology

Women's studies scholars have called for greater recognition and appreciation of early women scholars, researchers, and activists during this formative period in the discipline's development (Crocco and Davis, 1999; Frankel and Dye, 1991; Hayden, 1992). Sociology has only recently begun to acknowledge the contributions of women leaders and their organizations during the early years of the discipline (Deegan, 1978; Kandal, 1988; Smith, 1998). This paper focuses on just a few of the Progressive Reform Era women's clubs active in social reforms: Domestic Science and the Municipal Housekeeping movements. Only a few of the voices of the first generation of founding mothers are highlighted here (Clark, 1973; Gilman, 1991; Gordon, 1990; Gusfield, 1955; Hunt, 1942; Richardson, 2002; Scott, 1992).

So-called ‘starchitects’ such as Libeskind are increasingly conscious of the complex identity discourses within which their work is situated, with competing identity claims evidenced not only in the actual form of buildings, but also in the abstract narratives architects use to situate their work in a way that avoids (symbolically) privileging one identity over another.The capacity of architects to position their buildings in this way provides the focus of this article, which argues that architects’ discourses frequently reveal many tensions between culture, politics, power, and identity.The symbolic nationalization of the architecture at the Ground Zero site has, in part, been achieved by the narrative, highly symbolic links between the buildings there and an ‘American’ collective identity.",sociology
10.1177/0011392114559847,"This article focuses on the social and cultural aspects of the unprecedented and unparalleled proliferation of food-related allergies and intolerances. It thus aims to contribute to filling the theoretical lacunae in the current sociological approach to this fairly recent phenomenon. The article’s framework is divided into four segments. First, the rise in food allergies is placed within the field of the social history and medicalization of allergies, and seeks to understand the phenomenon in the context of the industrialized modern world. The following section discusses how and why lay experts are increasingly dominating the food allergy-related discourse. Drawing on recent empirical data, it is further shown how food allergies rise along with a population’s affluence and education. Third, the idiosyncrasies of food allergies and intolerances are addressed with respect to food consumption and its changing social implications. It is argued that individualization places less pressure on individuals to conform to broader social norms of food refusal, which offers the sufferers with a newly acquired sense of control over a random, scientified, and confounding food availability and provides a medium to covertly convey their educational and socioeconomic background. Lastly, the health belief model is applied in order to suggest a further potential explanation for the current increase in self-reported food allergies and intolerances.",sociology

Where parts of Max Weber's The Rational and Social Foundations of Music focus on the distinctive `ethos' of creative composition within the rise of modern music, passages in Georg Simmel's Schopenhauer and Nietzsche address the specific `logos' of modern performance as an autonomous expression of metaphysical will, and the final chapters of W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk are concerned with the `pathos' of listening as a potential way of transcending social divisions. The social contexts, cultural contents, and personal motivations of these proto-sociologies of music are shown to articulate a contrapuntal or `lyrical' sociology which is attentive to the production, distribution, and consumption of cultural forms along with the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic aspects of social life itself.",sociology

Sociology remains in high demand by students and faculty hiring remains strong, even in its more critical sub‐fields, such as race and ethnicity, sex and gender, and social inequality. Holmwood is correct that sociology is vulnerable to external pressures to demonstrate its relevance to social practice, but those pressures come from left‐wing social movements as well as from centres of power. He is also correct that external pressures contribute to internal disagreement, but sociology has been at war with itself since the 1960s, with little evident decline in its academic standing or intellectual vitality.

This is induced by the claims of rational choice theorists that extending this model from economics to sociology can be conducive to establishing a unifying paradigm and method to be given `paradigmatic privilege' within sociology. The outcome of such an extension of the economic approach has been `sociological rational choice theory' or `rational action theory for sociology'. Within sociology, such a rational choice model is regarded as a major theoretical or/and methodological innovation and thus a `new' promise for sociology's unification. Overall, the paper suggests that these `ecumenistic' claims of rational choice theorists cannot be taken at face value since they are predicated upon dubious views of the relations between economy and society and between economics and sociology, including inadequate interpretations of neoclassical economics.",sociology

To show that his approach can provide predictions he uses aggregate supply and demand curves to analyse the exchange of advice for compliance within a work group, and from this derives predictions about status differentiation. However, his use of aggregate supply and demand curves requires, first, that what is being exchanged should be additive; second, that actors should evaluate exchanges by universalistic criteria; and, third, that they should act atomistically. The third assumption seems implausible within a work group, but, if it is valid, it follows that predictions cannot be made about status. This is because status differentiation can be said to occur only when there is both social distance and differential esteem between actors, and because differential esteem is likely to arise only within solidary groups.",sociology

To track trends in sectoral sociology, scientists turn to scientometric methods, but they are not enough. Trends in the development of the sociology of values as a branch of sociology are the subject of the study. The purpose of the work is an assessment of the possibilities of using natural language analysis methods (NLP/NLA) for thematic and theoretical clustering of research in the sociology of values. The design of the study was quantitative and qualitative, it was carried out in two stages. At the first stage, 121 abstracts of a scientific articles were analyzed using text mining, after which their total array was divided into clusters. At the second stage, the results of machine clustering were examined by the method of qualitative text analysis, on the basis of which the limitations and capabilities of the NLP/NLA method were identified for solving the problem of clustering scientific texts. It was found that articles with a more conservative core of theoretical categories (gender studies, migration studies, the theory of globalism) are more amenable to clustering, while theories with a loosely structured and fluid theoretical core (theories using environmental terminology, theories of inequality) are much less amenable to explicit clustering. The results obtained allow us to form a new direction of work with large arrays of scientific texts, associated with their clustering using NLP/NLA. Building clusters enables researchers to work with all texts in a given subject area, and not just with the most cited ones. This, in turn, provides the visibility of all scientific ideas, including those that have not gained popularity/notability.",sociology

					</jats:bold> This contribution is an outline of the life, work and scientific impact of the Leipzig cultural historian Karl Lamprecht (1856–1915); Lamprecht's work was very controversial within German historiography at the turn of the century. He was accused of writing history from a materialist viewpoint. Anong his international contemporaries, however, Lamprecht was held in high esteem. There are divergent evaluations of the consequences of his methodological and substantive suggestions in the inter‐war era, in the era of the Third Reich, and later in the two German states which emerged after 1945. The article tries to highlight some lines of continuity which point especially to the regional historiography and to the sociology of the 1920s and 1930s.

I introduce existing perspectives on height from various disciplines, including biomedical discourses on the factors (e.g. nutrition, genetics) that determine height, economic discourses on how the average heights of populations have changed over time, sociobiological and psychological discourses that assume a pre‐cultural, evolutionary “height premium”, and popular discourses on heightism and height discrimination. Drawing from a diverse range of scholarship since Saul Feldman called for a “sociology of stature” in the 1970s, I then present ways in which height and height differences have figured in various domains of human experience, from employment and education to sports and social relationships. Finally, I survey people's attempts to become taller or shorter, and the implicit values that inform such height‐making practices. What these figurations and practices show, I argue, is that height intersects with notions of race, class, gender, and beauty – but is irreducible to any of them, and is thus best viewed as a distinct, embodied form of distinction, difference, and inequality.

These three debates help us clarify some key theses in our long-term understanding of nations and nationalism: processes of nation and nation-state formation are not opposed to but compatible with the rise of globalisation and non-state forms of governance; the question ‘when is a nation?’ combines modern and pre-modern dimensions; the politics of nationalism is neither unfailingly democratic nor exclusively regressive. A key paradox that unfolds is that all nations invest heavily in the production and reproduction of their own exceptionalism.,sociology

A concern with death is not absent in sociological thought. To the contrary, Durkheim’s Suicide grounds a sociological research tradition into death and dying. Yet Heidegger’s existentialism renders our finitude – not just death – a matter of everyday life, a constitutive feature of human existence and a source of sociological investigation. By explicating Heidegger’s interconnected concepts of finitude, futurity, authenticity and resoluteness, we propose to investigate people’s ordinary temporal experiences as well as the institutional contexts that make them possible. On this basis, we develop two concepts – existential marginalisation and existential exhaustion – that foreground questions of time, meaning and institutions in the study of poverty, inequality and everyday life.",sociology

As work itself starts to lose its familiar outlines, the employment paradigm that formed during the industrial period seems increasingly inapplicable. Such transformations give rise to criticism of existing concepts and the emergence of new discourses that simultaneously expand and complicate an understanding of the prospects for further development. In this article, we attempt to uncover problems that limit the possibility of generalizing scientific understanding in the field of sociology of work. Particular attention is paid to the integration of Russian experience into the global agenda. The review highlights the importance of clarifying the blurred conceptual framework of the sociology of work, enhancing the distinction between work and life, and identifying the possibilities and limitations of using big data for empirical analysis. In conclusion, we emphasize the need to counter the fragmentation of the sociology of work and its “dissolution” into other areas of knowledge by providing a strong theoretical background while maintaining the comparability of measurements.

The process of diagnosis provides the framework within which medicine operates, punctuates the values which medicine espouses, and underlines the authoritative role of both medicine and the doctor.

It is argued here that this reproductive interpretation is based on Chapter 3 of The Rules of Sociological Method (1895), but that Durkheim himself rejected it altogether in his later writings. From his 1898 article, ‘Individual and Collective Representations,’ to The Elementary Forms of Religious Life of 1912, Durkheim came to see one activity of society – the transformative activity of collective ideation – as unconcerned with the satisfaction of purely morphological needs. The point, however, is not that Durkheim’s sociology developed from a morphological approach governed by a principle of self-reproducibility to a psychological approach that transcends the production/reproduction dichotomy. The article argues instead that by neglecting the contribution of the discipline of sociology, and of the epistemological principles on which it is based, to the instituting activity of collective ideation, the reproductive interpretation offers only a partial reading of The Rules of Sociological Method: sociology, as a scientific form of collective ideation, actually instantiates its transformative, even subversive, force.",sociology

It provides a comprehensive analysis of how socioeconomic status, race, gender, culture, and other social determinants influence health behaviors, access to healthcare, and the experience of illness. The chapter also explores key concepts such as the social construction of illness, medicalization, and the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. Through comparative analysis, it examines different healthcare systems worldwide, the impact of globalization, and the role of international organizations in shaping global health policies. The discussion extends to emerging trends and challenges in the field, including digital health, mental health, and global health inequities. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research and interdisciplinary collaboration in medical sociology to inform public health policies and promote equitable healthcare systems.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0058,"<p>Recent years have seen a rapid growth in interest in the addition of a spatial perspective, especially in the social and health sciences, and in part this growth has been driven by the ready availability of georeferenced or geospatial data, and the tools to analyze them: geographic information science (GIS), spatial analysis, and spatial statistics. Indeed, research on race/ethnic segregation and other forms of social stratification as well as research on human health and behavior problems, such as obesity, mental health, risk-taking behaviors, and crime, depend on the collection and analysis of individual- and contextual-level (geographic area) data across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Given all of these considerations, researchers are continuously developing new ways to harness and analyze geo-referenced data. Indeed, a prerequisite for spatial analysis is the availability of information on locations (i.e., places) and the attributes of those locations (e.g., poverty rates, educational attainment, religious participation, or disease prevalence). This Oxford Bibliographies article has two main parts. First, following a general overview of spatial concepts and spatial thinking in sociology, we introduce the field of spatial analysis focusing on easily available textbooks (introductory, handbooks, and advanced), journals, data, and online instructional resources. The second half of this article provides an explicit focus on spatial approaches within specific areas of sociological inquiry, including crime, demography, education, health, inequality, and religion. This section is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to indicate how some concepts, measures, data, and methods have been used by sociologists, criminologists, and demographers during their research. Throughout all sections we have attempted to introduce classic articles as well as contemporary studies. Spatial analysis is a general term to describe an array of statistical techniques that utilize locational information to better understand the pattern of observed attribute values and the processes that generated the observed pattern. The best-known early example of spatial analysis is John Snow’s 1854 cholera map of London, but the origins of spatial analysis can be traced back to France during the 1820s and 1830s and the period of morale statistique, specifically the work of Guerry, d’Angeville, Duplin, and Quetelet. The foundation for current spatial statistical analysis practice is built on methodological development in both statistics and ecology during the 1950s and quantitative geography during the 1960s and 1970s and it is a field that has been greatly enhanced by improvements in computer and information technologies relevant to the collection, and visualization and analysis of geographic or geospatial data. In the early 21st century, four main methodological approaches to spatial analysis can be identified in the literature: exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), spatial statistics, spatial econometrics, and geostatistics. The diversity of spatial-analytical methods available to researchers is wide and growing, which is also a function of the different types of analytical units and data types used in formal spatial analysis—specifically, point data (e.g., crime events, disease cases), line data (e.g., networks, routes), spatial continuous or field data (e.g., accessibility surfaces), and area or lattice data (e.g., unemployment and mortality rates). Applications of geospatial data and/or spatial analysis are increasingly found in sociological research, especially in studies of spatial inequality, residential segregation, demography, education, religion, neighborhoods and health, and criminology.</p>",sociology

In fact, the reception of Ibn Khaldun by modern scholars in the West can be differentiated into Eurocentric or Orientalist as opposed to more disciplinary attitudes. While much has been said about the Eurocentric reception of Ibn Khaldun, less is discussed about the disciplinary approach to Ibn Khaldun among thinkers who wrote when the modern science of sociology was emerging in Europe. This special issue on Ibn Khaldun in the Formative Period of Sociology provides English translations of six articles originally written in Italian, French, German, Polish, Spanish and Turkish between 1896 and 1934. Not all of these articles were written by sociologists. Together, they provide some background as to how Ibn Khaldun was conceived of in non‐area studies circles, in the social sciences and humanities.",sociology

I consider these contributions and advocate for an interdisciplinary research agenda that continues expanding relational scholarship by developing the concept of the politics of erased migrations, an analytical tool to theorize why and how the embodied experiences of Latinas are marginalized and misrepresented in academic research. Latinas experience various physical and symbolic migrations—across and within national borders, social and political contexts, identities, academic disciplines, methodologies, and social movements. Yet Latina feminist experiences, knowledge, and political movement largely remain at the margins of these borders. Through a review of prominent research on gender and migration centered on heteronormativity, reproduction, and the nation‐state, I demonstrate the possibilities of the politics of erased migration as a theoretical intervention in expanding a relational, intersectional sociology of Latinx gender and migration. This paper carries implications for shifting the field of Latinx gender and migration from a focus on current oppressive conditions to one that also imagines new avenues for social justice and alternative social worlds.",sociology

These discourses have been reignited in recent years by changes in the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicalised cosmetic procedures. The most popular of these procedures are non‐surgical ‘tweakments’ to the shape and/or appearance of the face, usually through use of ‘injectables’ such as Botox and dermal fillers. This shift in focus from surgical procedures to minimally invasive injections has led more practitioners to join the market of potential providers and a wider variety of consumers to seek them out. This has been accompanied by panic about the risks to bodies and aesthetic standards if stewardship of beauty should fall into the wrong hands. We trace the history of medicalised cosmetic practices and academic discourses on the body, particularly how cosmetic practices are understood to produce the body as gendered and racialised. We then suggest future approaches for exploring the sociological significance of new cosmetic practices. We encourage researchers to explore how imaginaries of (un)desirable bodies shape debates about appropriate use of non‐surgical cosmetic procedures, alongside investigation of the situated intersections of identity that are inscribed on bodies.",sociology

With a primary focus on the diagnosis of attention deficit‐hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this paper seeks to accomplish four goals. First, this paper will summarize the general concept of medicalization, including the way that medical practitioners attribute children’s behavioral problems to disease entities. Second, this paper argues that the medicalization of childhood and the rise of the disease entity of ADHD stems from the transformation of children and childhood into objects of scientific study. Third, using the example of ADHD, this paper will attempt to demystify the premise that medicalization emanates from the “monolith” of medicine, but is instead, a process rife with internal contradiction and epistemological disagreement. Fourth, following the uncertainty of etiological positions toward childhood behavior problems, this paper will discuss some of the external critiques of medicalization, including the way that lay actors push back against the medicalization process, and concerns about the effectiveness of technologies used to diagnose and treat ADHD.",sociology

Despite its growing uneasiness about these facts, social science has not produced much theoretical innovation about them. This article aims to contribute to this task, by bringing to bear a conceptual framework elaborated by Shmuel N. Eisenstadt through his reflections on modern barbarism. I argue that the author’s understanding of barbarism has a significant interpretive potential for the sociological analysis of contemporary radical identities, and suggest some ways to reconsider ‘populism’, thereby redefining the very concept of radicalism. The article starts by introducing the pivotal notions which constitute the conceptual framework of our author. The following section outlines the main argument of Eisenstadt’s theory of barbarism, unpacking the way in which those concepts interweave to conjure a cultural theory of exclusionary, violent identities and institutional regimes. The final section highlights the significance of such approach for a cultural sociology of radicalism, by exploring the relations between the author’s views and some selected trends in contemporary social theory.",sociology

It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the `networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace.

In this regard, I am less interested in providing an overview of the different research streams of the main sociologists operating in the scientific and academic institutes located in Berlin than in reconstructing some crucial dynamics at work there and highlighting their effects at the social and symbolic levels. The underlying idea is that, especially in East Berlin, the sociological knowledge produced was less homogeneous than it has been represented in the existing literature. Without negating the existence of shared aspects characterizing Marxist-Leninist sociology, also superimposed on the political elite, a field analysis enables us to see how the different positions and trajectories of GDR-sociologists had an impact on their approaches to theoretical, epistemological, and methodological questions, and on their understanding and uses of concepts deriving from both Marxist-Leninist and “bourgeois” sociology. In the analysis, I will first compare the social trajectories of two of my interview-partners as paradigmatic of two different sociological habitus depending on their different academic/political socialization, networks, and positions in the field. As a second step, I will present a sketch of the sociological field drawn from 63 curricula of sociologists active in East Berlin in an attempt to pinpoint, on a larger scale, the homologies between the social and symbolic spaces of the field. Thus, the underlying idea is to examine the intersection of the “quasi-structural properties” of the field with its “phenomenological aspects” concerning the “feel for the game.” While the two understandings of field are interdependent, it is in the second one that the physical space as a localized social space played a crucial role in defining the material, social, and cultural constraints and opportunities actors faced which, in turn, influenced their practices and choices.",sociology
10.1111/1468-4446.12038,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>This paper re‐examines the sociological study of resistance in light of growing interest in the concept of affect. Recent claims that we are witness to an ‘affective turn’ and calls for a ‘new sociological empiricism’ sensitive to affect indicate an emerging paradigm shift in sociology. Yet, mainstream sociological study of resistance tends to have been largely unaffected by this shift. To this end, this paper presents a case for the significance of affect as a lens by which to approach the study of resistance. My claim is not simply that the forms of actions we would normally recognize as resistance have an affective dimension. Rather, it is that the theory of affect broadens ‘resistance’ beyond the purview of the two dominant modes of analysis in sociology; namely, the study of macropolitical forms, on the one hand, and the micropolitics of everyday resistance on the other. This broadened perspective challenges the persistent assumption that ideological forms of power and resistance are the most pertinent to the contemporary world, suggesting that much power and resistance today is of a more affective nature. In making this argument, it is a <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">D</jats:styled-content>eleuzian reading of affect that is pursued, which opens up to a level of analysis beyond the common understanding of affect as emotion. I argue that an affective approach to resistance would pay attention to those barely perceptible transitions in power and mobilizations of bodily potential that operate below the conscious perceptions and subjective emotions of social actors. These affective transitions constitute a new site at which both power and resistance operate.",sociology

I then examine the terms of Go's invitation more closely. I contrast Go's juxtaposition of imperial sociology on the one hand and anti‐colonial sociology on the other hand, with the broader range of theoretical traditions and methods, which a practice‐oriented sociology of sociology and an international history of sociology would highlight. I raise the question what “standpoint” adds to the authors Go discusses and the broader range of scholars who have engaged with post‐colonial contexts in their research at this point in time. Calling for consideration of the anti‐colonial standpoint is a particular choice, which has a distinctive heritage in Hegelian‐Marxian projections of the social whole and is in tension with either deep exploration of particular thinkers or the middle‐range theorizing that Go also seems to endorse. Defined at a level of abstraction that is “above” (or underneath) actual conversations in a range of fields and subfields, it can appear as a “test” for scholars who have long engaged with post‐colonial contexts, which can have unintended consequences when coupled with the institutional power and asymmetric insularity of Anglo‐American academia.",sociology

Furthermore, as a reading of Bateson through the lens of Durkheim will show, Bateson’s theories fail to provide a better understanding of social reality than those of his predecessors. This type of critical analysis demonstrates the weakness of some of Bateson’s central claims and contributes to a more in-depth understanding and reassessment of his ideas from a sociological perspective. Pointing out that Bateson’s critique of the modern worldview is based on a pre-critical and pre-modern philosophy of wholeness is not to invalidate Bateson’s foundational intuition that our current mode of thinking challenges our chances of surviving as a species. However, in order to make a theoretically convincing argument concerning how our thinking challenges our survival, a more critical understanding of the relation between mind and society than the one Bateson offers is required.",sociology

After taking issue with the familiar characterization of sociology as quintessentially modernist, where modernist equates to `reductionist' and `simplistic', three more specific interventions are construed as contributions to the complexity debate. One is the growing preference for inter- and post-disciplinarity over traditional (socio-logical) disciplinarity. The second is John Urry's proposal for new rules of sociological method along the lines of chaos and complexity theory. The third is the assumption that in the `network society' analysis of authors like Manuel Castells we have a substantive account which conforms directly to that fluid philosophical mind-set, rather than to conventional sociological framings. Since I do not seek to devalue complexity discourse as such, and since I advance support for the idea of trans-disciplinarity, the aims of this article are not merely conservative.

That it is a topic of interest to academics across the humanities and social sciences is itself a reflection of the gradual separation—over many centuries—of religion from public affairs in modern, largely secular, societies of the West. The readmission of religion to the public sphere raises several key issues, not least around secularization (and the extent to which religion has been disassociated from public life and policymaking), but also about the resurgence of religious conservatism as an attempt to close the gap opened up in modernity between religion and politics. The renewal of interest in religion as a social, cultural, and political force—a feature of what some are now calling the “post-secular”—has proved especially contentious in diverse, multifaith liberal democracies, where attempts to divorce religion from public life can be seen to undermine the inclusion of religious minorities and the expression of religious identities. Academic interest in the intersection between religion and public life has been concentrated largely among sociologists (of religion) and political scientists. The revival of religion in the public sphere confounds a widely held assumption among modern social and political theorists; namely, that religion would wither as a feature of public life as societies underwent a process of modernization—and where religion continued to exist at all, it would be confined to the private, domestic sphere and that of individual belief. Particular interest has been generated by controversies that expose the vexed nature of attempts to limit or bar the admission of religion in public life; such as the 1962 ruling by the US Supreme Court removing prayer from public schools (in the spirit of the First Amendment of the US Constitution), or, more recently, the banning of religious headscarves (and other “ostentatious” symbols of religion) from public schools in 2004 by the French authorities (in the spirit of secularism—or laïcité) enshrined in Article 1 of the French Constitution). Attempts to undo the “wall of separation” between religion and state first envisioned by Thomas Jefferson can be seen in attempts by American religious conservatives to overturn “progressive” legislation on abortion, gay rights, and same-sex marriage. Recent opposition in the United Kingdom by Muslim conservatives to LGBT education in public schools illustrates the sensitivities and tensions surrounding expressions of RPS in contemporary Western societies.</p>",sociology

               The concept of social class (class) is intricately entwined into the discipline of sociology. Both the discipline and societal concern with class emerged from disruption of the Industrial, American, and French Revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries. All noted sociological scholars since those times have addressed class as a core aspect of their work. Yet the literature on the class position of Indigenous Peoples is scant to the point of nonexistence. This chapter examines the place and conceptualizations of class as understood within the Western sociological literature. These conceptualizations are then interrogated on their applicability and their usefulness for Indigenous Peoples living in Anglo-colonized nation-states. The concept of class is then re-envisioned through the theoretical lens of the Indigenous lifeworld. The chapter concludes that the Indigenous class position cannot be understood unless it is placed and analyzed within its present and past social-structural context of colonization.",sociology

The Western-framed writings around race continue to miss or misrecognize core aspects of Indigenous lifeworlds. This critique is present in various forms across the nine chapters in this section. All chapters are linked by their engagement with race as a key concept of their analysis, and, more critically, in their presentation of alternative Indigenous philosophies on the sociology of race. In reading across the contributions, four central themes emerge: the distinctive processes and impacts of racialization for Indigenous Peoples in colonial settler states, the importance but oft-neglected aspect of sovereignty, the centrality of dispossession and land to Indigenous experiences of race, and the importance of local epistemologies for refashioning sociological concepts of race.

Outside institutions, including foreign governments, can help resolve ethnic conflicts by providing guarantees that facilitate ethnic bargaining.",sociology

Designed to explain the two basic types of cognitive processing—one autonomous and the other requiring controlled attention, dual-process models became a natural partner for sociological theories of action, with their interest in parsing dispositional and deliberative types of action. This chapter offers an analytical review of the sociological literature that engages with dual-process models. It begins with an outline of the fundamentals of dual-process models in cognitive and social psychology, and follows with an examination of the premises that constitute what has come to be called the sociological dual-process model. It then reviews sociological research that applies dual-process models, dividing this literature into two distinct groups that are separated along sharp epistemological, methodological, and analytical lines. The first group is a largely consistent body of work that follows the premises of the sociological dual-process model, emphasizing the primacy of Type 1 processing, and investigating how this form of cognition shapes action. The second group comprises a more diverse body of work, examines Type 1 and Type 2 processing, and attempts to capture the processes that shape cognition and action. The chapter concludes with remarks about the critiques raised against dual-process models, along with their potential contributions to sociological analysis.",sociology
10.62272/js.v14.a2,"This paper focuses on the theoretical debates in sociology that acted as the driving force in its course of development drawing heavily from the thinking of Alvin Gouldner. Revolutionary transformation in the French society in late eighteenth century and the subsequent social disorder created the background of the development of positivism by Comte with the advocacy of restoring social order. Intermingling of different theories also took place as in the case of positivism furnishing the context for the emergence of structural functionalism. Interpretative sociology brought new dimension to the understanding of social phenomena by highlighting the perspective of the actors instead of the observer. In this vein it also discusses the emergence of intersubjectivity, ethnomethodology and related theoretical views. For obvious reason the paper deals elaborately with the perspective of Marxism. It underlines that structural functionalism presents society as an interwoven equilibrium while Marxism views the same as a conflicting whole with the effect of domination by the ruling class. This paper elaborates on the basic tenets of historical materialism as couched in Marxism. However, Marxist prognosis faltered in advanced capitalist countries of the Western hemisphere calling for new theoretical insight. Within Marxism it happened by examining the causal background of the continuation of capitalist countries, elaborated in this paper in the section on structural Marxism. The premise of sociology also necessitated the emergence of Durkheim and Weber who argued for different perspectives for the understanding of social order. The contributions of system theory and interactionism are duly acknowledged in this paper to weave a comprehensive intellectual tapestry being linked with debates and argumentation. The parallelism of system and individual brought dualism in sociological theory and Anthony Giddens took up attempt to draw a conflation between the two, unfolding a new dimension in the debate ridden sociological theories. The paper concluded with the discussion of Derrida and Lyotard to unfold the novel approach of post-modernism in challenging the claim of universality of modern theories.",sociology

In developing this theme, the article examines empirical evidence from recent UK studies of family relationships, exploring why ‘display’ is important in contemporary family relationships as well as the process through which it occurs.

This debate focuses either on the organisation of sociology in academic institutions or on how the content of sociologically informed interdisciplinary research diverges from disciplinary sociology. This article bridges these debates in a study of the sociology of food in Sweden. The aim is to analyse how Swedish food sociology reflects the tension between disciplinary sociology and interdisciplinary research. The data comprise the doctoral dissertations and post-PhD career paths of Swedish sociologists whose dissertations are about food. The article finds that these dissertations treat food either as an inherently social phenomenon or as a social lens (i.e. a social phenomenon viewed as instrumental for analysing something else). Second, it is found that sociologists whose dissertations treated food as an inherently social phenomenon were more likely to pursue careers in food sociology but also to hold affiliations outside of sociology departments. The article concludes that the academic locus of Swedish food sociology is organised outside sociology departments but that its approaches are not necessarily any less sociological. Thus, the analysis questions the basis for arguments that interdisciplinary research represents a threat to the critical and analytical core of sociology.",sociology

If engaging mortality is conceived as an example of the thinking of limits, I suggest that this ban parallels disavowing the question of meaning that the bourgeoisie have cultivated and perfected in the name of practical thinking. In this way, the bourgeoisie can be said to have mastered the secret of life and the connection between mental hygiene and intellectual parsimony celebrated by Kant as the advance of enlightenment. This adjustment is located at least as far back as the Stoics and replayed in much thought and in popular culture as a symptom of the self-destructiveness of the fixation on ‘ultimate meaning’ and its realistic pursuit in life. In this sense, the conditions of citizenship in the city are said to require a systemic disregard of such ‘deep’ concerns on Kantian grounds that their inaccessibility and irresolute character can only distract circumspection from its limited goals. Georg Simmel is maintained as the classical figure who both engaged death (and so the risk of thinking limit) and suffered marginalization for this, making his resolution of this tension not tragic, as his idiom suggests, but an exemplification of sociological artistry and of the playful relationship to life that it promises when unencumbered by the fear of the bourgeoisie.",sociology

After taking issue with the familiar characterization of sociology as quintessentially modernist, where modernist equates to `reductionist' and `simplistic', three more specific interventions are construed as contributions to the complexity debate. One is the growing preference for inter- and post-disciplinarity over traditional (socio-logical) disciplinarity. The second is John Urry's proposal for new rules of sociological method along the lines of chaos and complexity theory. The third is the assumption that in the `network society' analysis of authors like Manuel Castells we have a substantive account which conforms directly to that fluid philosophical mind-set, rather than to conventional sociological framings. Since I do not seek to devalue complexity discourse as such, and since I advance support for the idea of trans-disciplinarity, the aims of this article are not merely conservative.

That it is a topic of interest to academics across the humanities and social sciences is itself a reflection of the gradual separation—over many centuries—of religion from public affairs in modern, largely secular, societies of the West. The readmission of religion to the public sphere raises several key issues, not least around secularization (and the extent to which religion has been disassociated from public life and policymaking), but also about the resurgence of religious conservatism as an attempt to close the gap opened up in modernity between religion and politics. The renewal of interest in religion as a social, cultural, and political force—a feature of what some are now calling the “post-secular”—has proved especially contentious in diverse, multifaith liberal democracies, where attempts to divorce religion from public life can be seen to undermine the inclusion of religious minorities and the expression of religious identities. Academic interest in the intersection between religion and public life has been concentrated largely among sociologists (of religion) and political scientists. The revival of religion in the public sphere confounds a widely held assumption among modern social and political theorists; namely, that religion would wither as a feature of public life as societies underwent a process of modernization—and where religion continued to exist at all, it would be confined to the private, domestic sphere and that of individual belief. Particular interest has been generated by controversies that expose the vexed nature of attempts to limit or bar the admission of religion in public life; such as the 1962 ruling by the US Supreme Court removing prayer from public schools (in the spirit of the First Amendment of the US Constitution), or, more recently, the banning of religious headscarves (and other “ostentatious” symbols of religion) from public schools in 2004 by the French authorities (in the spirit of secularism—or laïcité) enshrined in Article 1 of the French Constitution). Attempts to undo the “wall of separation” between religion and state first envisioned by Thomas Jefferson can be seen in attempts by American religious conservatives to overturn “progressive” legislation on abortion, gay rights, and same-sex marriage. Recent opposition in the United Kingdom by Muslim conservatives to LGBT education in public schools illustrates the sensitivities and tensions surrounding expressions of RPS in contemporary Western societies.</p>",sociology

               The concept of social class (class) is intricately entwined into the discipline of sociology. Both the discipline and societal concern with class emerged from disruption of the Industrial, American, and French Revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries. All noted sociological scholars since those times have addressed class as a core aspect of their work. Yet the literature on the class position of Indigenous Peoples is scant to the point of nonexistence. This chapter examines the place and conceptualizations of class as understood within the Western sociological literature. These conceptualizations are then interrogated on their applicability and their usefulness for Indigenous Peoples living in Anglo-colonized nation-states. The concept of class is then re-envisioned through the theoretical lens of the Indigenous lifeworld. The chapter concludes that the Indigenous class position cannot be understood unless it is placed and analyzed within its present and past social-structural context of colonization.",sociology

               The key Indigenous critique of mainstream sociology is the long-standing failure of the discipline to engage meaningfully with either the concept or lived reality of colonialism, which is evidenced in the mainstream scholarship of race. The Western-framed writings around race continue to miss or misrecognize core aspects of Indigenous lifeworlds. This critique is present in various forms across the nine chapters in this section. All chapters are linked by their engagement with race as a key concept of their analysis, and, more critically, in their presentation of alternative Indigenous philosophies on the sociology of race. In reading across the contributions, four central themes emerge: the distinctive processes and impacts of racialization for Indigenous Peoples in colonial settler states, the importance but oft-neglected aspect of sovereignty, the centrality of dispossession and land to Indigenous experiences of race, and the importance of local epistemologies for refashioning sociological concepts of race.

It was mostly the product or sequel of what economists (Schumpeter 1954) call the Copernican marginalist revolution in economic theory during the 1870–90s. Specifically, the crux of marginalism was a marginal‐utility theory of exchange value and its extensions (e.g., marginal‐productivity principle of income distribution) in reaction and contrast to the labor‐cost conception in classical political economy. The founders or pioneers of marginalism are commonly considered to be William Jevons (England), Carl Menger (Austria), and Leon Walras (Switzerland/France), who almost simultaneously in 1871–4 “discovered” marginal‐utility value theory as a putative revolutionary alternative to its labor‐based versions in Smith, Ricardo, Mill, Marx, and others. (For instance, Jevons specifically attacked Ricardo and Mill's theories, prompting neoclassical economists like Alfred Marshall to rise in their partial defense.) The term neoclassical economics was invented by (Thorstein Veblen Groenewegen 1995), a heterodox institutional economist, in the early 1900s to indicate that marginalism (e.g., marginal‐utility theory) was, in virtue of utilitarianism and hedonism, essentially continuous with and so “scarcely distinguishable” from classical political economy (which apparently overlooks the opposition of the marginalist revolution to Ricardo et al.'s labor theories of value). In this sense, the terms marginalism and neoclassical economics become interchangeable, though the first term is probably more accurate and precise for describing this stage and type of economic theory. Moreover, historians of economics such as Schumpeter (1954: 919) object that “there is no more sense in calling the Jevons‐Menger‐Walras theory neoclassic than there would be in calling the Einstein theory neo‐Newtonian.” This suggests that neoclassical economics is essentially marginalism (with partial exceptions like Marshall), but not conversely: the marginalist revolution is not newly, but counter‐classical (that is what makes it presumably “Copernican”).",sociology

Accounts provided in a survey of 250 individuals who knew people who had died in the UK are examined. The analysis counters the view that the denial of death is widespread in conditions where religion no longer offers individuals a meaningful narrative for the dying self. Scripts for proclaiming heroic self-identity in the face of death are promoted by cultural experts and appropriated by many lay individuals. This involves a struggle against external and internal enemies to gain knowledge, the opportunity to demonstrate courage and a beatific state of emotional accompaniment in which `carers' and dying people participate. Unlike more traditional forms of heroism, this script deviates from celebrating solely masculine qualities and includes a female heroics of care, concern and emotional expression.  At the same time, some deaths cannot be written into this script, which is particularly well suited to deaths from cancer and AIDs. The deaths of the very old, the mentally confused and sudden unexpected deaths are often difficult to interpret in these heroic terms. Additionally, a rival script exists amongst some lay individuals that stands in opposition to the professional consensus on the desirability of open awareness. This emphasises the benefits of continuing the everyday project of the self oblivious of oncoming death, with others shouldering the burden of awareness in an attempt to protect the dying person against the strain of knowledge. This rival script, however, commands decreasing allegiance in a society where the project of the self is rarely given over to the care of others, and trust is commonly negotiated in confessional moments.",sociology

A topic in moral philosophy for centuries, it has sociological aspects that have not been well studied. Inevitably, there is a complex range of functions motivating moral‐giving actions, including the social ends (benefits, rewards, etc.) that motivate donors. Assuming not to distinguish between motive and function as (potential) drivers, this study presents an analysis of the social motivations of moral giving from an integrative perspective. First, a particularist approach is considered and a novel synthesis of the micro‐macro dichotomy is outlined. Then, five major motivations or perspectives on moral giving are identified – those of religion, exchange relations, solidarity, rational choice, and social capital – and their micro/macro orientations and intersecting functions are briefly reviewed. An integrative model is thereby developed that incorporates mutually transitive relations between macro structures and micro agents and between the various social motives of moral giving.",sociology

Major areas of investigation include the social determinants of health and disease, the social behavior of patients and health care providers, the social functions of health organizations and institutions, the social patterns of the utilization of health services, the relationship of health care delivery systems to other social institutions, and social policies toward health. What makes medical sociology important is the critical role social factors play in determining or influencing the health of individuals, groups, and the larger society. Social conditions and situations not only promote and, in some cases, cause the possibility of illness and disability, but also enhance prospects of disease prevention and health maintenance. The earliest works in medical sociology were carried out by physicians in the United States, not sociologists who tended to ignore the field. This changed in the late 1940s when large amounts of federal funding became available to support joint research projects between sociologists and medical doctors. At its inception, work in medical sociology was oriented toward finding solutions relevant for clinical medicine. However, in 1950, Talcott Parsons, the leading theorist in sociology at that time, introduced his concept of the sick role that subsequently attracted other theoretical work and had an important role in the emergence of medical sociology as an academic field. Medical sociology has evolved to the point today that it investigates health and medical problems from an independent sociological perspective.

Tourism cannot be treated in isolation since it embodies all tourism practices in a system they operate in. Thus, tourism is a complex sociocultural, economic, and political phenomenon and touches all levels of society. The investigation of tourism’s role in society, the tourism system’s effects on nature, tourism spaces, objects, practices, relationships, and the tourist typologies demand systematic sociological investigations. A researcher needs to consider the whole macro system through its members’ social, political, cultural, and economic interactions. In such a social context, both human and nonhuman actors continuously shape and reshape the tourism system, and the tourism system reshapes these actors’ values, attitudes, and behaviors. Researchers examining the sociology of tourism departed from several theoretical Perspectives, blended theory and method, and focused on sociological concepts to understand and explain the different aspects of tourism. This group of scholars has been working within the several cores of sociology (e.g., education, family, economy, development, religion, gender, language, migration, social inequalities, labor, art) and at the margins of emerging interdisciplinary formations, including those crossing many disciplines such as geography, anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, marketing, communication, women’s studies, history, and cultural studies.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0187,"<p>Cognitive sociology is the study of the conditions under which meaning is constituted through processes of reification. Cognitive sociology traces its origins to writings in the sociology of knowledge, sociology of culture, cognitive and cultural anthropology, and more recently, work done in cultural sociology and cognitive science. Its central questions revolve around locating these processes of reification since the locus of cognition is highly contentious. Researchers consider how individuality is related to notions of society (structures, institutions, systems, etc.) and notions of culture (cultural forms, cultural structures, sub-cultures, etc.). These questions further explore how these answers depend on learning processes (socialization, acculturation, etc.) which vary according to the position one takes on the role of language in cognition. It is from these positions that we operationalize a theory of human nature and construct a justification for the organization of the state of human affairs and the related conceptualizations of identity, self, and the subject. In this way, cognitive sociology seeks to establish the minimal model of the actor (the ontology) that underpins not only other subfields of sociology but also the human sciences in general. In this way, cognitive sociology analyzes the series of interpersonal processes that set up the conditions for phenomena to become “social objects,” which subsequently shape thinking and thought. In classical cognitive sociology, the historical traditions of the sociology of knowledge and phenomenology are emphasized, with the work of Bourdieu and Goffman given special treatment, given their contributions as precursors to many of the contemporary contingencies and consequences of debates in culture and cognition. The principle organizing the more contemporary literature are the paradigmatic assumptions concerning the locus of cognition, which have been organized into five ideal-types. These elucidate the points of agreement and disagreement in the field by addressing how thematic concerns (e.g., knowledge, rationality, embodiment, practices, discourse, etc.) highlight the priority of individuality in modeling society, to illustrate what makes cognitive sociology at once interdisciplinary yet contentiously distinct in addressing the politics of “tacit knowledge.”</p>",sociology

It emphasizes those conceptualizations excluded from canonizations of knowledge. This knowledge cultural sociology (KCS) recognizes the importance of the Mannheimian tradition, and its extensions, that explain how social relations shape the articulations and validations of knowledge. However, KCS also situates knowledge within systems beyond those who produce and consume it. KCS views knowledge as itself necessarily contested, as struggles over its qualities reflect social locations and articulate social practices. In making knowledge over the subject of inquiry, KCS works to understand how knowledges’ symbols, schemas, institutions, and networks shape the terms of social reproduction and transformations. As such, KCS demands consideration of different kinds of knowledge cultural products and modes of communication. KCS is thus necessarily grounded in the question of what constitutes knowledge, and for whom and with what interests and expectations. This KCS intervention focuses on 21st-century work. This decision aims to engage scholarship that extends and challenges a 20th-century canon; including works from the 20th century signals scholarship yearning for expansion. The article is not comprehensive, but marks how knowledge is valued and ignored. To focus on this century and move beyond sociology allows engagement with ways of knowing and being that sociology has historically minoritized, moving consideration to structures and processes validating some kinds of knowledge over others. KCS is not canonization, but works toward liberation, a knowledge activism mobilizing knowledge in consequential public ways alongside more familiar scholarly ambitions. KCS moves scholarship beyond familiar networks and self-reproducing knowledge hierarchies grounded in race, gender, sexuality, religion, and world region. It seeks to move dialogue beyond knowledge silos and to identify new and ignored ideas, meanings, references, and authorities for constituting knowledges of consequence, reframing contests along the way. For example, instead of asking how excellence and diversity can be combined in knowledge production, KCS asks what anti-racist knowledge excellence can be. Accounts of epistemology ought to foreground the contexts and power relations in which those knowledge sensibilities are formed and communicated; thus, the references in this article move generally from concept to context. Likewise, sections moving toward global, post-socialist, and postcolonial discussions inform ontologies and epistemologies organizing scholarly work and public consequence. But this begins with what might be identified, in this entry at least, as the greatest hits of KCS.</p>",sociology

The field incorporates insights from economics, behavioral psychology, economic anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Structural and cultural approaches largely characterize the studies conducted in the field, with the former associated with networks, institutions, and social organization; the latter, rituals, symbols, cognitive frameworks, and narratives. Economic sociologists study how social networks and relationships affect economic actions, such as the provision of loans, the acquisition of a job, and the successful construction of deals. Empirical studies examine how prices are set, why some pricing schemes that do not seem rational are instead understandable and predictable, and how markets are incorporated into social life, and vice versa.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0154,"<p>Rural sociology is a unique area of sociological inquiry. Its institutional development leaves it perhaps the most independent of all sociological subfields. Rural sociology in the United States emerged in the early 20th century when federal funding was earmarked to the land grant universities (public universities) to study and assist the farm population. Separate “rural” sociology departments appeared gradually within colleges of agriculture that paralleled the substantive areas found in general sociology departments. Thus, one finds in rural sociology a replication of many core areas in general sociology but with a rural twist—inequality, demography, work/labor markets, race/ethnicity, gender, community, and so forth. Over time, additional rural-oriented specialty areas emerged, notably the sociology of agriculture and natural resource/environmental sociology. Rural sociology has also expanded globally. As a consequence, the substantive scope of contemporary research is large and varied. What knits the work together is a focus on the geographic periphery, that is, the places, populations, and forms of social activity found in rural areas globally which has provided boundary and meaning to the field. In addition to its broad substantive scope, rural sociology is characterized by a distinct research approach. Research tends to be comparative: rural places and populations are often set in contrast with regard to their urban counterparts to ascertain similarities and differences. In this way, rural sociological research is often said to challenge the urban bias of general sociology. Disciplinary practice is also distinct. While there are few departments with rural sociology in their name today, courses and specializations in the field are found across many land grant universities. There is a long tradition of cross-disciplinary linkages particularly with agricultural economics, the environmental sciences, and more recently geography. Rural sociologists have been highly active in federal, state, and local public policy circles and in public sociology efforts that contribute to community development, sustainable agricultural and food systems, and social and environmental justice. In terms of work in the profession, rural sociologists also work outside of colleges of agriculture, within government agencies, international development agencies, and across governmental and non-governmental institutions. Although rural populations will continue to decline globally, there is reason to think that rural sociology will have broad influence in the future because the research areas it encompasses are of growing interest to social scientists, policymakers, and the public at large. Issues addressed by rural sociologists pertaining to the sustainability of the food system, climate/environmental change, and rural poverty are among the most pressing public concerns today.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0009,"<p>Comparative historical sociology is the branch of sociology that analyzes society-wide transformations, such as social revolutions, the rise of capitalism and the nation-state, democratization, and the birth and transformation of welfare states. At the end of the 19th century all of sociology’s European founders turned to historical explanation to understand the changes that capitalism had brought to their societies, from Marx’s attempt to explain history as the working out of class struggle, to Weber’s investigations into the comparative development of economy and society, to Durkheim’s investigations into the historical development of religion, law, and the division of labor. These early historical arguments were eclipsed, however, by the behavioral revolution and the explosion of statistical tools and techniques of the mid-20th century, which re-founded the discipline as the study of large numbers of individual actors or units. Only when revolutions and social change became increasingly pressing political concerns in the 1960s and 1970s did a large number of scholars once again turn to comparative historical sociology as the form of sociological explanation most appropriate to analyzing changes that occur infrequently or over very long periods, and that affect a society as a whole unit. While the classics of the discipline focus on European history, contemporary scholars are extending the approach to the rest of the world. Current areas of great interest include the question of why China did not experience an industrial revolution in the 18th century, the role of the state in economic development, and the transition to capitalism in eastern Europe. Some think that the study of rare events requires different methods from those common in the rest of sociology, and accordingly a lively methodological discussion is underway in the field. Because there has been great interest in the state as the source of much social transformation, the subfield overlaps considerably with macro political sociology; but comparative historical scholars are also interested in processes of social and economic change beyond the realm of the political.</p>",sociology

The study of music in society has been of interest to canonic social thinkers, including Weber, Simmel, and Adorno, since the establishment of sociology. The study of music has also concerned scholars in adjacent disciplines, particularly musicology, cultural studies, and economics. In the landmark Distinction, Bourdieu argued, “nothing more clearly affirms ones ‘class,’ nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music” (Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste [London: Routledge, 1984], p. 18). Sociologists of music have accordingly been concerned with the importance of musical taste for signifying status and distinguishing cultural hierarchies. Sociologists have also been concerned with the socio-demographic correlates of musical preference, how musicians and the music industry organize to provide music and influence taste, and the education and working conditions of musicians. What tends to distinguish sociology of music from other disciplines is a commitment to the sociological imagination or the use of social research methods—but not necessarily both. And many sociologists of music work across disciplines. Sociologists have also coalesced around the study of different genres, and those contributing in the sociology of particular genres often do so not as sociologists but as music, folklore, or history scholars whose interests have extended to the sociology of music. The American sociology of music tradition has arguably been influenced more heavily by symbolic interactionism and rational choice theory than the European, where critical theory has been more influential. Nevertheless, conceptual and methodological interchange is growing, particularly with the increasing influence of Bourdieu in US sociology. The sociology of race, gender, and sexuality has also influenced the field significantly. This conceptual and methodological diversity means the field has low paradigmaticness. However, this diversity does lead to productive exchange and synthesis of ideas and methods. Notably, there is growing interest in music as a social technology and insights from science and technology studies. As in cultural sociology more broadly, attention is turning to “the music itself,” music as mediating social interaction, and artists and works embedded in wider socio-musical systems using computational tools, particularly network analysis. Data proliferation is generating innovative quantitative work. Qualitative research is also being reinvigorated by new technologies enabling new interview methods, digital ethnography, and computational methods for processing textual data.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0055,"<p>Culture is the symbolic-expressive dimension of social life. In common usage, the term “culture” can mean the cultivation associated with “civilized” habits of mind, the creative products associated with the arts, or the entire way of life associated with a group. Among sociologists, “culture” just as often refers to the beliefs that people hold about reality, the norms that guide their behavior, the values that orient their moral commitments, or the symbols through which these beliefs, norms, and values are communicated. The sociological study of culture encompasses all these diverse meanings of “culture.” Amid this diversity, what unifies the sociology of culture are two core commitments: that the symbolic-expressive dimension of social life is worthy of examination, both for its own sake and because of its impact on other aspects of social life; and that culture can be studied using the methods and analytic tools of sociology. Within the discipline, the sociology of culture emerged as a bounded subfield during the 1980s. Prior to this period, sociological analyses of culture were found mainly in theoretical treatises and in empirical studies of religion, the arts, and the “sociology of knowledge.” Throughout, the sociological study of culture has been oriented by a common set of broad questions: What are the social origins of culture? What cultural patterns are found in various groups and institutions? And what influence does culture have on important aspects of society? Scholarship in the sociology of culture ranges from highly general conceptual arguments to closely observed empirical studies. The readings included here reflect this breadth.</p>",sociology

A related subfield is military sociology, which focuses more explicitly on the organization and functioning of military forces and civil- military relations. These lines of scholarship are bound together by the basic premise that understanding war necessitates understanding those who fight it, and vice versa. The sociology of war overlaps with other fields that share an interest in government and politics, such as military history, political sociology, political science, and international relations. However, these fields tend to be concerned primarily with how wars begin and end, whereas the sociology of war tends to focus more explicitly on the cultural and social implications of war and how war and society act and react upon each other. With a few notable exceptions, the sociology of war remained mostly isolated within the field of comparative historical sociology until the 1980s, when two trends opened the door for an interdisciplinary sociology of war. The first was the dissipation of a war taboo, widespread in American academia and connected to the social resistance against the Vietnam War throughout the 1960s and 1970s. A renewed interest in the social implications of war also occurred as the end of the Cold War raised new questions about the role of the state in war making and the future of warfare. Renewed interdisciplinary interest in the origins of the modern nation-state led to a reexamination of the role that warfare played in the emergence and spread of the state system. In the decade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2011 the sociology of war focused extensively on questions related to the role of nonstate combatant groups, the apparent increase in asymmetrical war in the post–Cold War era, and the meaning that such transformations in war making may carry for the societies that wage them. As the Global War on Terror nears the end of its second decade, scholars have increasingly turned their attention to understanding the interactions between state and society as the lines between peacetime and wartime become less distinguishable. Most recently, the sociology of war has exhibited a broadening in scope, with greater emphasis on examining how war is situated within larger patterns of social violence.</p>",sociology

The enormity of the suffering has led to an interest in fascism and its origins, with the hope that understanding what it is and why it occurred will prevent it from happening again. The sociological study of fascism is historical, interdisciplinary, and comparative. A key feature of the scholarship is the debate about fascism’s definition. Because it was the world’s first fascist regime, some claim that the characteristics of Italian fascism under Mussolini should form the basis for the definition, or that Italian fascism is the only instance of fascism. Others argue that the political ideologies and groups that marked the first half of the 20th century had a number of features in common and that, although fascism played out differently in national contexts, a generic definition is possible. Recent scholarship points to a consensus in favor of a generic definition. Fascism promised a solution to the divisions and decay wrought by liberal democracy and communism through mass mobilization, national cleansing, and national rebirth. Roger Griffin said fascism was “palingenetic populist ultranationalism” (Griffin 1993, p. 26, cited under Definitions). Whether fascism manifests as an intellectual current, social movement, political party, or regime also figures in its definition because fascism’s form affects what it can do. Some comparative research focuses on differences between fascism and other authoritarian, conservative, or right-wing groups, as well as relations between fascists and these groups. Since the rebirth that fascism promises usually entails controlling biological and cultural reproduction, women’s roles in fascist ideology and regimes have been the subject of recent studies. Scholars have also likened fascism to religion, for its reliance on myths, symbols, rituals, and commemoration in both ideology and practice, and have studied fascism as an example of totalitarianism, often in comparison to communist Russia. Debates about the definition of fascism are inextricably linked to theories of its emergence. Some scholars explain fascism’s origins by looking at intellectual, cultural, political, or economic factors. Others claim that the only way to understand why fascism occurred is to study its leaders and their intentions (e.g., Adolf Hitler), and its members, voters, and supporters. The definition of fascism and its organizational form also affect which countries are studied, whether for case or comparative analysis. Italy and Germany have received the most attention, but many other countries are the subject of inquiry too. Some scholars have examined dozens of countries in an effort to classify them as fascist or otherwise. The scope of fascist studies expands as new insights emerge, as more disciplines become involved, as new methods of inquiry are developed, and as new sources of data become available, such as archives in Russia, eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Vatican. Finally, many scholars are preoccupied by the possibility of fascism’s return in today’s far right in countries all over the world. These are studies for which questions about definition and origins are also important, but perhaps more pressing are concerns about the activities of these groups and whether they pose a threat to democracy and, if so, how to contain them.</p>",sociology

Broadly, sociolinguists investigate the relationship between social context and language structure or use on the assumption that aspects of structure and use require reference to social context for their description and explanation. In practice, the “socio-“of sociolinguistics can refer to three things, separately or in combination: an act or action of language use that requires, minimally, two people for its performance or one person acting as two; language use that is connected to the identity or identities, be they achieved or attributed, of a speaker or speakers; and/or language use that is involved in the expression of ideology. Using these three types of social facts, we may ask how researchers find the social in a sociolinguistic analysis of structure and use. We suggest here that sociolinguists use three fundamental approaches. Each involves a positioning of the social with respect to the linguistic or the linguistic with respect to the social. These approaches are: Constraint Approach: One may find the social as extra-linguistic constraints or conditions on use of competing forms. Indexicality Approach: One may find the social as indexed by structures/forms, codes (styles, dialects, languages), or acts. Discursive Construction Approach: One may find the social in the explicit and inferrable details of collaborative, sequential, discursive construction. Because the Indexical and Discursive Construction approaches overlap, we will present selected readings in two broad categories. In the first, we will focus on research in Variationist Sociolinguistics which most aptly illustrates the Constraint Approach. However, in Variationist work, the Indexical Approach also appears within research into the Social Meanings of variation. In turn, we will review key publications in socially informed discourse analysis which further illustrate both the Indexical and Discursive Construction Approaches.</p>",sociology

A number of key questions can be raised about any given preservation effort: What kinds of claims are being made when mnemonic activists declare a building or a neighborhood to be “historic”? Whose vision of history is being wielded when monuments and other spaces of consecration are laid down in the urban fabric? What are the cultural frames that are mobilized to socially construct such landscapes as “historic” versus those are simply “historical”?

In order to situate the idea of financialisation in a sociological context, I show how the financial crisis of 2007-2008 gave weight to the weightless fictitious capital of the fully financialised world in the form of the dead weight of debt that crushes the indebted and creates a new power relation, which Maurizio Lazzarato writes of in terms of the creditor / debtor relation. While economics tends to conceive of debt in terms of number and objective mathematical calculation, the idea of the weight of debt focus upon the subjective experience of indebtedness founded upon a particular subordinate subject position, the debtor, which it then becomes possible to understand sociologically and critically oppose on the basis of different value systems.</p>",sociology

Previously, studies of food production and consumption typically fell under the purview of research on health, agrarian studies, development sociology, agricultural economy, or social anthropology. Rural and natural resource sociologists especially have long emphasized the management and impacts of food production systems in their work. In classical tomes food was typically mentioned as an example of social classification or of social problems rather than a distinct object of study. Since the 1980s sociologists’ attention to how food strengthens social ties; marks social and cultural differences; and is integrated into social organizational forms, ranging from households to empires, has grown. Early-21st-century interest in food by both researchers and the larger public follows heightened awareness of the global character of markets and politics, concerns with health and safety, and the ways cooking and dining out have become fodder for media spectacle. Today sociologists of food display considerable diversity in their theoretical approaches, research methods, and empirical foci. Sociologists draw upon both classic and contemporary sociological theorists to study food’s production, distribution, and consumption as well as how food and eating are integrated into social institutions, systems, and networks. Topically, sociologists contribute to research on inequality and stratification, culture, family, markets, politics and power, identity, status, social movements, migration, labor and work, health, the environment, and globalization. Sociological work on food in the late 20th and early 21st centuries is characterized by two overlapping threads: food systems (derived in part from scholarship on agricultural production and applied extension as well as environmental, developmental, and rural sociology) and food politics, identity, and culture (which reveals social anthropological and cultural-historical undertones). Both are nested in the emerging interdisciplinary research field of food studies, which has gained greater institutional footholds at universities in Europe and Australia than in the United States and Canada (but this may be changing). Sociologists working across the two threads examine issues of food and inequality, trade, labor, power, capital, culture, and technological innovation.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0259,"<p>Conservatism refers to one of the constituent political positions found in all contemporary democracies. It can be construed as a philosophy, an ideology, a political party, a movement, a disposition, a mode of discourse, performance style, and an emotional relationship to the political. Since the birth of modern democracies in the aftermath of the French Revolution, it has become commonplace to describe the range of political options available to the citizenry as occupying a spectrum from left to right, with a range of alternatives between the extreme poles, including a centrist position in the middle that straddles the divide. The left was associated with promoting challenges to established authorities and existing hierarchies, along with calls for increased economic equality and expanded social and political rights to all citizens, including the heretofore marginalized. This contrasts with the right, which was defined as defending inequalities and differential entitlements, concentrating matters involving rights around preserving property rights, shoring up public and social order, and promoting traditional values and conventional social relations. In this context, liberalism became a mark of political identity associated with the left, as did socialism, while conservatism, broadly construed, represented the right. This framing of politics also includes the possibility of underminings by extremism on both the left and right. For the former, the main threat since the Russian Revolution has been posed by revolutionary communism, while right-wing extremism has manifested itself in reactionary movements, including fascism and illiberal populism. Since liberalism and conservatism must be understood in relational terms, the spatial and temporal settings for the politics of opposition will vary considerably. It is impossible to do justice to the vast literature on conservatism in a bibliography such as this. What follows is a more delimited, and thus manageable examination of work on conservatism. First, it focuses on conservatism in the United States, and not elsewhere. Second, it is chiefly concerned with conservatism since the end of World War II. Third, it concentrates on the study of conservatism by sociologists and those working in cognate disciplines; while not all the authors are card-carrying sociologists, their works reflect a sociological character, although the exception to this third point is the overview section, which presents key readings by advocates of conservatism, and thus offers insider depictions of the meaning of conservatism. Fourth, this article does not concentrate solely on extremist right-wing movements; rather, in surveying the relevant literature on American conservatism broadly construed, it points to a growing consensus that the radical right wing has pushed mainstream conservatism increasingly further to the right.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0075,"<p>A rudimentary definition of consumption emphasizes the purchase and use of goods or services, noting that the point of expenditure on such items and the instant of their usage constitute the act of consumption. This understanding of consumption reflects a utilitarian, economic approach to consumption that should be seen as a starting point, since the range of theoretical and empirical innovations within the field of consumption studies—which exists within sociology, as well as having disciplinary expressions within anthropology, history, geography, business, and marketing studies—has established an understanding of consumption as a complex, widespread process. “The Sociology of Consumption” by Colin Campbell in Daniel Miller, ed., Acknowledging Consumption: A Review of New Studies (London: Routledge, 1995) adds a number of other stages to this basic definition of consumption. Campbell states that consumption involves not just purchasing or using a good or service but also selecting it, maintaining it, possibly repairing it, and ultimately, disposing of it in some way. Within each of these stages there are a number of complex subprocesses that consumption studies scholars have increasingly paid attention to. For example, the selection of goods is sometimes undertaken largely subconsciously or automatically but also based upon various social norms, cultural learning, emotional factors, prejudices, facets of identity, taste, or style. Likewise, disposing of a good may mean literally throwing it away, or it may mean reselling it, donating it, or passing it on to others. Campbell’s definition usefully shows how consumption is a process over time that fuses practical, emotional, material, and economic factors, rather than merely the moment when a person pays for something over the counter. In many ways, this broader understanding of consumption points to a range of innovations within the field that have occurred in the last few decades, which in turn direct us to broader changes in patterns of sociological inquiry. Questions of labor, industry, production units, social, legal, and economic institutions, technology, and social class were the core stuff of social inquiry through much of the 20th century. In mainstream sociology, consumption was for most of the discipline’s history simply not a relevant analytic category, which explains why for much of sociology’s history consumption was understood through theories of capitalist production. However, in the last few decades researchers have increasingly situated practices of consumption and a consumerist ethic as central for understanding broader social and cultural change, impacting on the way sociologists have conceptualized such diverse areas of social change as cultural and economic inequality, urban and spatial development, identity and selfhood, gender relations and performativity, media, and advertising.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0036,"<p>Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the study of knowledge, with knowledge traditionally defined as justified true belief. Classical epistemology set up a dualism between the mind and a material reality external to the mind. The problem to solve then became that of explaining how ideas in the mind could be known to mirror objects outside the mind. For the rationalist tradition, the solution to this problem lay in arguing that the mind had a priori ideas, meaning ideas that existed independently of experience. For the empiricist tradition, the solution to this problem lay in arguing that the mind had a posteriori ideas, meaning ideas stemming from experience or, more precisely, sense data inputs. Alternative positions could adhere to some form of idealism or skepticism. With idealism, reality becomes defined in terms of our ideas of it, and with skepticism it is held that knowledge cannot be attained because we can never know if our ideas mirror objects outside our minds. Later, philosophical attention turned from the issue of discussing whether or not ideas in the mind could mirror objects outside the mind to language. Debates then ensued about whether truth was a matter of correspondence between a statement and a fact. Philosophers concerned with scientific knowledge addressed the issue of what method defined science. For many, there could be a sociology of error but not a sociology of knowledge. What this meant was that while a diligent application of the scientific method would explain the production of truth, error could be explained by “social factors” distorting this process. Examples of social factors could be religious or political commitments. In sociology, epistemology is not a clearly defined topic. Instead, there are a broad range of issues, which may be summarized with the following questions: Should sociology seek scientific knowledge and, if so, how is science to be defined? Can qualitative research give explanatory knowledge of relations of cause and effect as well as quantitative research? Should sociology reject any attempt to explain relations of cause and effect, on the basis that social reality does not have law-like phenomena, in order to understand the shared meanings of agents? How can theoretical abstractions be justified? Should sociologists adopt a broad definition of knowledge to include agents’ understanding of the social and political world, irrespective of whether agents’ beliefs are actually true? Should all domains of knowledge, including the knowledge produced by the natural sciences, be regarded as influenced by sociocultural factors or even completely relative to the prevailing sociohistorical environment? Should value judgments influence the production and dissemination of sociological knowledge? Has sociological knowledge contributed to the reproduction of inequalities by ignoring women and using a research process that is ultimately hierarchical and oppressive?

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0131,"<p>Many historians contributed to what is now social history before the mid-20th century, but as a field social history was increasingly precisely defined beginning in the 1930s in France (as part of the Annales school), and from the 1960s in the English-speaking world. (Indeed, for several decades the field seemed so innovative that it was regularly termed the “new” social history.) The field has two foci. First, social history emphasizes large numbers of people in the past, rather than just elites or leading individuals. Common categories include social classes, Gender, Race and ethnic group, and age. Social historians see the history of ordinary people as contributing greatly to an understanding of the past, and often they argue that ordinary people display more independent initiative than was commonly assumed by conventional historians. Often some tension emerges between a focus on groups of ordinary people as targets of mistreatment and the claims of more active agency. Second, and closely linked originally to the focus on ordinary people, social historians analyze a variety of aspects of human and social behavior. They reject the tendency of conventional historians to concentrate heavily on formal politics, diplomacy, and great ideas alone. This aspect of social history has expanded steadily. It leads to a host of subfields, including family and childhood, leisure and consumerism, health and disease, and crime, and the list continues to grow as historians respond to changing social patterns and needs. Some tension has developed between interest in a wider range of topics and the earlier commitment to ordinary people, as some new topics are best explored, at least initially, through elite or middle-class sources. Social history’s topical range has also fueled complaints about a lack of overall coherence, though social historians frequently organize their many topics around major developments like industrialization. Many historians identified themselves strongly as social historians during the early decades of the field’s emergence. This singular identification has softened over time, and many historians in the early 21st century “do” social history as part of a larger commitment, usually to a geographical region. Social history has also drawn different levels of attention in various world regions. The field is better developed, for example, in China or the West than in the Middle East. Finally, social historical work has often, but not always, developed with some interdisciplinary connections, particularly to historical sociology.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0134,"<p>The term cultural omnivorousness was first introduced to the cultural consumption literature by Richard Peterson in 1992 (see Peterson 1992 [cited under Reference Texts]) to refer to a particular cultural appreciation profile. According to his definition, this profile emerged in the late 20th century, in accordance with macro changes experienced in the socioeconomic and political spheres. Omnivorous consumers have an increased breadth of cultural taste and a willingness to cross established hierarchical cultural genre boundaries. In other words, the concept refers to a taste profile that includes both highbrow and lowbrow genres. Peterson’s initial studies—with Kern and Simkus—used data on tastes in music in the United States. Later, especially after researchers in Europe developed an interest in the term, many other cultural consumption domains were analyzed to see whether highbrow taste profiles tend to become less exclusive. This interest has been so consistent that we now have sufficient empirical and theoretical research to label the discussion a coherent sociological “debate.” The relationship between omnivorous orientation and variables such as education, age, gender, class, ethnicity, and race has been analyzed in many different national contexts and cultural fields. The omnivore thesis is extremely important for contemporary cultural theory because it pushes researchers to scrutinize the current status of the relationship between culture and power. The contributors to this debate have provided competing answers to the following crucial questions: What is the strength and direction of the association between socioeconomic status and cultural taste? Are we witnessing the decomposition of cultural-class boundaries and snobbishness? How far does cultural omnivorousness bring tolerance and cultural inclusion? These questions, asked within the debate, demonstrate the concept’s significance for our understanding of sociocultural change. Many case studies have shown that eclectic repertoires are more likely to be embodied by the educated middle classes. Peterson himself argued that the employment market has begun to seek this kind of wide-ranging awareness and cultural inclusiveness. It seems that being a true omnivore requires certain skills, investment, and prior cultural knowledge, which can be translated into advantages in other social fields. Moreover, empirical research is now sufficient enough to show that omnivores are selective and they show little tolerance for the genres associated with lower social/cultural status. Therefore, this repertoire may very well be considered a new form of distinction—a strategy the economically and culturally advantaged use to “make” their identity and distinguish themselves from others. The debate has progressed quite successfully. Many different types of omnivorousness have been discovered since the term was first coined; not every eclectic repertoire holder follows the same trajectory of boundary crossing. For instance, some omnivorous consumers cross the highbrow-lowbrow boundary by adding highbrow genres to their profile after having experienced upward mobility, while others include lowbrow genres to their once exclusive highbrow taste repertoires. Different forms of omnivorousness—and their degree of cultural tolerance—allow us to see more clearly the current status of the association between cultural hierarchy and consumption. Although limited in quantity, some important research has been done critically questioning the kind of social structures, institutions, national contexts, and school curricula that enlarge the cultural cultivated fractions’ repertoires. Recent research on contemporary forms of cultural capital and cosmopolitanism also engages closely with the omnivore debate. It is important to note that arguments still remain with regard to methods and analysis; not every contributor agrees on a common definition for measurement—operationalization—of the omnivore profiles. Some researchers take participation, while others take taste or knowledge, as proxies to measure omnivorousness. Some contributors measure only the breadth (the status of the genres preferred) and others measure volume of tastes (the number of preferred genres/activities) without looking at their composition, namely how far people cross boundaries. Other disagreements (methodological and theoretical) with regard to other aspects of the debate have been briefly referred to above. These disagreements not only make the debate more lively and dynamic, but also ensure that interest in the concept does not decrease over time.</p>",sociology

Originating in the work of Max Weber, this division, by asserting the independent influence of status groups and interests, represented a key departure from Karl Marx’s insistence on the primacy of economic or class relationships. Despite the long-established prominence of this concept in the field of sociology, status has been variously defined and employed. Some definitions, following Veblen, focus on the individual aspects of status, referring to the rank, prestige, or esteem of one’s position in a social hierarchy. Other definitions focus on status groups or communities defined by shared lifestyles; these groups use these common status identities to gain access to valuable resources, privileges, and entitlements and defend those they already possess. Contemporary empirical research on status has focused primarily on socioeconomic status or experimental studies of small groups, although there is a burgeoning literature on the role that status plays in structuring markets and determining organizational outcomes.</p>",sociology

He first became interested in world affairs, particularly the anticolonial movement in India, as a teenager living in New York City. After serving in the US Army from 1951 to 1953, he wrote his MA thesis in the burgeoning subfield of political sociology, arguing that McCarthyism was only marginally against communism and, instead, was a program of the “practical right” against the “sophisticated conservatives.” His PhD thesis, however, was on the role of voluntary associations in nationalist movements in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. He won a Ford Foundation Fellowship to conduct his dissertation research in West Africa, working across linguistic barriers. In 1960, Wallerstein first met Frantz Fanon, who became an important and lasting influence on his work. In 1973, Wallerstein became president of the African Studies Association. As a result of his intellectual roots in Africana studies, national liberation, core-periphery relations, and critiques of Eurocentrism continue to be central concerns of his work. Wallerstein earned his BA (1951), MA (1954), and PhD (1959) from Columbia University, where he then joined the faculty. In 1968, he participated in and supported student protests against the university’s complicity in the Vietnam War. From 1971 to 1976, he taught at McGill University before joining the faculty at the State University of New York at Binghamton (SUNY Binghamton). At SUNY Binghamton, he founded the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations, one of the premier institutes supporting research in world-systems analysis. At the Fernand Braudel Center, he became founding editor of the journal Review, the first journal dedicated to world-systems research. In 1994–1995, he chaired the Gulbenkian Commission, which endeavored to break down the disciplinary boundaries among the historical social sciences. He remained at SUNY Binghamton until his retirement in 1999 and since 2000 was Senior Research Scholar at Yale University.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0167,"<p>In an increasingly global world with significant cross-border migration, societies inevitably contain people with different ethnic, cultural, and religious identities. In the context of the United States in particular, the presence of ethnic, cultural, and religious heterogeneity is more commonly referred to as diversity, while in most other contexts the mere presence of such heterogeneity is dubbed multiculturalism—the most general formulation of multiculturalism in sociology. However, multiculturalism is also an ideological position founded upon the claim that minority identities are important to the people who hold them, and that the identity groups they create will persist. Because identity and identity groups matter, they must be recognized and accommodated in social and political life. Generally speaking, the sociology of multiculturalism falls into six broad categories: the study of growing population diversity, commonly referred to as demographic multiculturalism; multicultural theory; multicultural policy; the impact of multiculturalism; the retreat from multiculturalism; and examination of multiculturalism as a cultural object. Due to its broad subject matter—recent and contemporary cultural diversity and the changes it has wrought in societies and nations—the study of multiculturalism is particularly interdisciplinary. The sociology of multiculturalism overlaps many other areas of research in sociology: migration and immigrant inclusion, national identity and citizenship, religious studies, and racial and ethnic studies, just to name a few. Multiculturalism is also a common subject in the fields of education, political science, philosophy, cultural studies, and history. This article focuses almost exclusively on work that is done in sociology and by sociologists. In addition, the sociology of multiculturalism is, most especially, an international field of research.</p>",sociology

The paper distinguishes between<jats:italic>Canadian Sociology</jats:italic>and the<jats:italic>Sociology of Canada</jats:italic>. The former involves the explanatory stance that one takes to understanding Canada. The latter addresses the significant social dimensions that underlie Canadian social organization, culture, and behavior. I make a case for a<jats:italic>Canadian Sociology</jats:italic>that focuses on the unique features of Canadian society rather than adopting a comparative perspective. I also argue that there is a continuing need within the<jats:italic>Sociology of Canada</jats:italic>to address the issues of staples development. However, I argue that “new” staples analysis must have a directional change from that of the past, in that social processes now largely determine the pattern of staples development. Moreover, new staples analysis must include issues that were never part of earlier staples analysis, such as issues of environmental impacts and of staples depletion under conditions, such as climate change. The paper concludes by analyzing four factors that provide the dominant social contexts for analyzing modern staples development: (1) the rise of neoliberal government, (2) the implementation of globalization and its social consequences, (3) the assumption of aboriginal rights and entitlement, and (4) the rise of environmentalism. These factors were generally not considered in earlier staples approaches. They are critical to understanding the role of staples development and its impact on Canada in the present time.Cet article est une version quelque peu révisé du cours pour le “prix pour contributions exceptionnelles” de l'auteur, présenté à la réunion annuelle de la Société Canadienne de Sociologie à Victoria, Colombie‐Britannique le 6 juin 2013.

Cependant, je soutiens que l'analyse des principales ressources “nouvelle” nécessite un changement de direction que celles du passé, en ce que les processus sociaux déterminent principalement le système de développement des principales ressources. De plus, l'analyse des principales ressources “nouveau” doit inclure les problèmes qui n’étaient jamais partis des analyses précédentes, comme les problèmes d'impacts environnementaux et de la diminution des principales ressources dans les conditions comme celui des changements climatiques.

In much sociology, women as a social group are invisible or inadequately represented: they take the insubstantial form of ghosts, shadows, or stereotyped characters. This issue of sexism has a direct relevance to the main topic of this book: a survey of housewives and their attitudes to housework which was carried out in London in 1971. The conventional sociological approach to housework could be termed ‘sexist’: it has treated housework merely as an aspect of the feminine role in the family — as a part of women's role in marriage, or as a dimension of child-rearing — not as a work role. This book thus departs from sociological tradition and takes a new approach to women's domestic situation by looking at housework as a job and seeing it as work, analogous to any other kind of work in modern society.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0138,"<p>Gender stratification refers to the social ranking, where men typically inhabit higher statuses than women. Often the terms gender inequality and gender stratification are used interchangeably. There are a variety of approaches to the study of gender stratification. Most of the research in this area focuses on differences between men’s and women’s life circumstances, broadly defined. Scholarly debates focus on which dimensions of inequalities are most relevant and the level at which inequalities are generated and maintained (i.e., individual, couple, family, group, or societal level). Researchers have been challenged to explore gender, race, and class inequalities from an intersectional perspective, rather than treating gender as independent of race and class. There is little acknowledgment of the heteronormativity that is present in gender stratification research. Perhaps that will change once data regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression becomes more widely available. In this section, we present key areas of gender stratification research. Gender stratification can be examined at the level of individual outcomes and interactions or with a macro perspective that compares indexes of gender inequalities across countries. Although welfare states research examines many aspects within and across societies, it provides important insights in how state policies can shape patterns of gender stratification. Gender inequality in the area of education, economic resources, and family are closely linked in individuals’ lives, but distinct strands of research have emerged and will be discussed separately. Although we provide examples of research noting gendered health disparities are outcomes of gender inequalities within societies, not all health research makes this connection. Research on crime as well as migration and citizenship has traditionally focused on men. Yet a recent shift to include women more explicitly and gender more broadly has great potential to inform other areas of research on gender stratification.</p>",sociology

Usually supported in research institutions as a core component of the discipline of sociology, social theory most commonly encompasses the range of explanatory concepts, analytical tools, and heuristic devices on which sociologists and social scientists draw in their efforts to interpret statistical or qualitative data about particular empirical social phenomena. Social theory in this relatively narrowly delimited sense is usually thought of as more or less synonymous with the term “sociological theory.” But many common understandings of the scope of the field also imply a wider range of reference than this. Social theory can name general sources of ideas about social phenomena relevant to other disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, such as anthropology, political science, economics, history, cultural and media studies, and gender studies. And social theory can also be thought of as incorporating normative concerns bearing on debates about desirable ends or values of social life—about how social life ideally “ought to be”—in ways that overlap closely with concerns in the fields of moral, political, and legal philosophy. As social theory in most of its central concerns names only a practice of systematic theoretical thinking relevant to particular substantive problems or questions in sociology and other social-science disciplines, some headings in this bibliographical survey of the field will be found to overlap thematically with other Oxford Bibliographies entries in sociology. For more detailed surveys of substantive areas in the Oxford Bibliographies listing with prominent theoretical components see especially: Comparative Historical Sociology, Chicago School of Sociology, World-Systems Analysis, Marxist Sociology, Feminist Theory, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Postmodernity, Symbolic Interactionism, and Michel Foucault. The emphasis of the survey that follows falls primarily on currents and schools of thought in Western social theory from the 18th century to the present day.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0059,"<p>Anarchism developed as a distinctive strain within radical and revolutionary thought in the mid-19th century. The political theory, often associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (b. 1809–d. 1865), Michael Bakunin (b. 1814–d. 1876), and Peter Kropotkin (b. 1842–d. 1921), appeared in parallel with a worldwide, international movement that shaped anarchist practices and that gave expression to a critique of capitalist exploitation, state tyranny, and an idea of rebelliousness that has been influential in sociopolitical, economic, and cultural realms. Contemporary anarchists argue about both the continuities and the discontinuities between the historical and modern movements and the antecedents of European anarchism, but there is a strong consensus that anarchism cannot be reduced to a single set of principles, conceptual arrangements, or theoretical positions that might be applied in practice, analysis, or critique. Because canonical approaches to the history of anarchist ideas are typically resisted, and because the ideological boundaries of anarchism remain contested, anarchist approaches to sociological issues are distinguished by their diversity and are difficult to pin down. However, the anarchists’ traditional opposition to processes associated with state formation, and their interrogation of the complex relationships between these processes and capitalism, society, technology, and culture, are important frames for the discussion of perennial themes, notably, domination, organization, and transformation. Reflections on the rise of the modern European state and the possibility of nonstate organization have long encouraged an interest in anthropology, supporting strongly normative accounts of mutuality, cooperation, and reciprocity. In the anticapitalist mainstream, anarchism supports a rich tradition of thinking about self-regulation, self-management, and decentralized federation. The anarchists’ principled rejection of authority has fostered an interest in systems of education, law, punishment, concepts of crime, and the institutionalization of love in heterosexual relationships, generating cultural practices and literatures that are at once subversive and utopian. Anarchist utopianism is in turn an important strain in urban design, art, and ecology. The anarchist eschewal of institutional politics and advocacy of direct action have focused attention on issues of struggle, protest, and violence as well as the theorization of direct action and prefigurative change. Notwithstanding anarchist suspicions of the elitism and complicity of academic institutions, anarchism has had an influence on mainstream sociology and is equally influenced by critical strains within it. The relationship with Marxism, though often unhappy, has provided one route into sociology. Max Weber’s engagements with anarchism have provided another; and, in late-20th- and early-21st-century history, anarchists have begun to develop approaches to sociology that resonate with both traditions.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0029,"<p>Genocide is now understood as a major type of collective violence, with a distinctive place in the spectrum of political violence, armed conflict, and war, of which it is usually seen as a part. However the idea of genocide dates only from the 1940s, when in the space of four years after its introduction (in a critique of Nazi occupation policies during the Second World War), it became the subject of a major international convention. The concept quickly become central to political and cultural discourses about violence, but the developed academic study of the phenomenon took some decades to develop, before finally taking off around the end of the Cold War. The rapidly expanding field is interdisciplinary, with major contributions from historians, sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, legal scholars, and others. It has highly contested parameters, including the definition of the phenomenon, the universe of cases, the appropriate explanatory frameworks, and so on. It is also considerably politicized, with significant disagreements over how the academic study of genocide should be related to the development of international policies for its prevention. The field’s growth came initially through the extension of understandings of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, which by the late 20th century was known as “the Holocaust,” to other cases, both historic (such as the Ottoman extermination of the Armenians) and contemporary (such as the Cambodian and Rwandan genocides). However, it has since expanded to consider phenomena quite different from the Holocaust in scale and form, such as the diverse and long-drawn-out pattern of genocide during European colonization of the non-Western world. At the same time, the transformations of political violence and war in the post–Cold War world have led to new divergences over the applicability of the genocide idea to recent events. Recent cases, such as the former Yugoslavia, have raised questions about the relationships of population removal and sexual violence to genocide. Because of these tensions, the growth of the field has been accompanied by theoretical, paradigm, and political differences. This bibliography attempts to capture these features of a fast-moving academic field and to provide the reader with a way to explore its essential literature.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0262,"<p>Sociology has an oddly imperfect, even problematic, relationship with public space (and space in general). Taking public space to mean any site that is, at least in principle, open and commonly accessible to all, it is of course the location for an enormous amount of all social interactions that occur outside of the intimacy of home or the professional context of work. It is the stage on which Goffman’s actors perform their presentations of self. From Simmel’s Metropolis and Mental Life through the research of the early Chicago School to countless contemporary ethnographies, urban space in particular is central to sociology. So much of social life takes place on streets or plazas, in public libraries, markets, and subway cars, or in so-called third spaces like cafes and pubs (public houses, after all). Public spaces have countless social characteristics and sociological implications. And yet relatively little sociological research focuses on public space itself, often relegating it at best to context—a crucial variable perhaps, certainly often a field site and the setting for a study, but rarely the object of analysis. Some sociologists who have followed a “spatial turn” are in truth interdisciplinarians by training (e.g., Herbert Gans, Neil Brenner); others began as sociologists and wound up rather outside of the discipline altogether (e.g., William H. Whyte). Still, public space is a natural domain of social research and ought to be a comfortable home to the sociologist. Whether for the pioneering community studies of the 20th century or today’s graduate students conducting surveys and observing daily life, the street corner, the park, the library are essential elements of study.</p>",sociology

This wide usage does not, however, mean that “class” is always defined in consistent ways by sociologists, or that it is necessarily among the most important factors in accounting for any particular social phenomena. There are two features that all conceptualizations of class share. The first is that societies are organized unequally in a vertical fashion, with some people at the top possessing more power, income and wealth, and privileges than people at the bottom. These advantages (or disadvantages) are rooted (at least in part) in the economic relationships between individuals and households. Exactly how classes are defined and categorized, however, remains contested. Second, all class theories start from the proposition that the types of class relationships found in any society matter for other social processes. At the micro level, class location of individuals or households predicts such things as income and wealth, social and political attitudes, marriage, friendships and social networks, voting behavior, cultural consumption, and life chances. At the macro level, class power influences policy and political outcomes, as well as social movement organizations and capacities.</p>",sociology
10.1177/003803857901300102,"The theme of this paper is that the content, form, location and social role of utopia vary with the material conditions in which people live. These variations have been obscured by definitions of utopia in terms of its function in catalysing social change, which has also produced the illusion that the contemporary Western world lacks utopias. By defining utopia with reference to its meaning to author and audience as an expression of their desires and aspirations, it is possible to trace a series of shifts in the English utopia, to relate these to one another and to the social context, and to show that the `absence' of contemporary utopias is simply another transformation of this kind. From being a spatially-located wish-fantasy, utopia moved through the function of social criticism to being a temporally-located catalyst of social change. These changes depended on perceptions of society-in-time as increasingly malleable and open to human control, culminating in the nineteenth century belief in progress. Utopia now appears to have reverted to the role of wish-fantasy as a result of a prevalent fatalism and a shift away from an evolutionary perspective, a change which, paradoxically, allows it to be more utopian by tying it less closely to reality. Utopia as a catalyst of social change depends on an optimism which is now absent.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0125,"<p>Ethnicity, and its sibling concept race, lies close to the center of sociological concern. Together these intertwining ideas constitute one of the driving forces in human affairs. Alongside class and gender, ethnicity and race amount to one of the primary axes of sociological analysis. Ethnicity and race have been especially prominent in sociological, political, anthropological, and historical analyses of the United States, but they also exist in every part of the world in local forms. Ethnicity and race are not quite the same thing, but they are intimately related, so their relationship, and the history of ideas about them, bears contemplating. The common view of both scientists and the general public for most of the last two centuries was that humankind is naturally divided up into four or five big races: white, black, yellow, red (and sometimes brown). Each was identified with origins in a different part of the globe: Europe, Africa, East Asia, the Americas (and sometimes the Malay Peninsula and island Southeast Asia). It was posited that each of these races constituted a separate type of people that could easily be distinguished from the others both by physical features and at the genetic level. Until the last few generations, scholars and the public presumed that each race also had a particular personality type, intelligence level, potential for achievement, and natural place in the social order. In the view common at that time, ethnic groups were seen as subgroups of races, marked off more by culture than by genetics. The European or white race included Swedes, Italians, Poles, Scots, and so on. The Asian or yellow race comprised Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, Pakistanis, and so on. The black or African race was made up of Ibo, Yoruba, San, Fulani, Bambara, Mandinka, and a host of other ethnic peoples. The common view was that race was about biology, but ethnicity was about culture and consent. One could not change one’s race, but one’s ethnicity was partly subject to choice. Certainly, in that view, ethnicity was a matter more of behavior than of biology. To be sure, mostly Muslim Pakistanis had different religious ways, foodways, languages, and child-rearing practices than did mostly Buddhist Koreans. Yet it was hard to deny that people from Korea also didn’t look very much like people from Pakistan. And it could not be denied that one could talk meaningfully about black culture in the United States or Britain. So as more and more people came into contact with people from different parts of the world, it became harder and harder to sustain the notion that races were big, permanent, and easily definable, and that racial boundaries were decided on a physical or biological basis, while ethnic groups were smaller subsidiary groups whose differences were cultural and mutable. Over the course of the 20th century, the notion of biologically separated races and culturally separated ethnic groups gradually gave way to a view of humankind as a single field of infinite variety, with one population shading, physically and culturally, into the next almost imperceptibly as one moved across the globe. Scholars and some of the public became aware that, whether one considered genotype or phenotype, the differences between the so-called races were really very small—much smaller than the biological similarities between them. And the physical differences between ethnic groups could be quite large—the average Pakistani does not look much like the average Korean; the average Norwegian does not look much like the average Italian. In the past few decades scholars have almost entirely eschewed the notion of races as longstanding, biologically discrete categories. Instead, they have emphasized that racial ideas were constructed by historical actors, in particular times and places we can identify, for reasons at which we can make at least educated guesses. Constructedness and contingency are at the core of our understanding of ethnicity and race in the 21st century. We have come to see race and ethnicity as processes more than categories. Many sociologists speak of racialization: a process by which one set of people writes a story of essential, indelible difference (and frequently inferiority) onto another set of people. Some people think of the differences between groups as ethnic—that is, as primarily cultural—until the racial moment, when someone imputes to those differences a primordial, indelible quality, and racialization occurs. Yet the residue of the earlier, biologistic view of race as something physical and indelible, but ethnicity as something cultural and malleable, still lurks beneath the surface, shaping the perceptions and actions of the general public and of more than a few social scientists. Though race is now seen as a socially constructed category, not a biological essence, race and ethnicity nonetheless operate powerfully to shape the life chances of individuals. Some people’s life chances are significantly greater than other people’s on account of the races, religions, or ethnic groups to which they are assigned. People kill people because of their race or their ethnicity—whether in Nazi Germany or the American South or the Balkans of the 1990s. The fact that race and ethnicity are social constructions rather than biologically based facts does not mean that they do not have powerful real-life consequences. This bibliography does not include studies of specific ethnic and racial groups, except in a few cases where particular group studies were classic markers in the development of the field of ethnic and racial studies. Researchers should look to other, group-specific Oxford Bibliographies Online for such studies of individual groups.</p>",sociology

However, in the last ten years the number of publications in the area has increased dramatically, and an Evolution, Biology and Society Section of the American Sociological Association was created in 2004. The name “biosociology” covers a wide range of topics, from microsociological to macrosociological, with the unifying feature being an acknowledgement of the role of biology in human social life. Researchers in the area use a variety of sociological methodologies as well as research results and methodologies from an array of disciplines including anthropology, behavioral genetics, history, primatology, palaeoanthropology, biology, psychology, and neurology. The field focuses on how evolved human biology interacts with particular social environments to both produce and simultaneously to respond to social institutions and structures.</p>",sociology

These variations are diverse and innate. Intersex human rights defenders and human rights institutions challenge the stigma and discrimination that intersex people face because of their physical variations, but few jurisdictions so far have tackled the human rights violations that intersex people suffer. There are multiple additional, contested, and incommensurate lenses through which intersex people are viewed. These express different values and beliefs about the same people, including their meaning, treatment, concerns, and demands. Medical lenses view intersex traits as “disorders of sex development” (DSD), and people with those traits are viewed as female or male and subjects for treatment. Anthropology and queer and gender studies have viewed intersex as an illustration of fallacies that underpin subjective cultural norms for sex and gender. Law increasingly views intersex people as members of a third sex. Historical research shows that intersex people, often termed hermaphrodites, have always existed, and often been accommodated.</p>",sociology

               This chapter critically reviews work of three representatives of the French tradition of psychologically informed sociology: Marcel Mauss, Pierre Bourdieu, and Loïc Wacquant. It considers both the institutional backgrounds to these scholars’ encounters with psychology and cognitive science and main aspects of the conceptual and methodological evolution that has occurred between Mauss and Wacquant, particularly as regards their use of the habitus concept. Finally, it considers the influence of French psychological sociology on contemporary cognitive sociology, surveying some of the theoretical and methodological innovations that have resulted as well as possible avenues for further development of these interdisciplinary fields.",sociology
10.1177/s003803859900019x,"The purpose of this paper is to describe an integrated (meta) theoretical framework that I call anti-reductionist sociology: this entails a focus on agency, structure (the `conditions-of-action'), and social chance; micro-macro; and time-space. What follows allows only for a sketch of the framework; I have published fuller theoretical, methodological and policy-related accounts elsewhere. Anti-reductionist sociology is a sensitising theoretical perspective, not a body of substantive theory. This differentiation has an affinity with Mouzelis's (1993:684) distinction between methodological generalisations and substantive generalisations, the present paper being concerned with the former. In Cohen's terminology (1987:279-80) the approach outlined in the paper is ontologically flexible and in some sense electic: while explicitly excluding reductionist, essentialist, reified and teleological formulations, anti-reductionist sociology is a synthetic metatheoretical framework designed to encourage the development of substantive theories that are not necessarily tied to any particular paradigm.",sociology

Current presumptions about the distinction between human behaviour and artificial intelligence are identified through a survey of discussions about AI and `expert systems'. These discussions exhibit a restricted view of sociological competence, a marked rhetoric of progress and a wide variation in assessments of the state of the art. By drawing upon recent themes in the social study of science, these discussions are shown to depend on certain key dichotomies and on an interpretive flexibility associated with the notions of intelligence and expertise. The range of possible associations between sociology and AI reflects the extent to which we are willing to adopt these features of AI discourse. It is suggested that one of the more important options is to view the AI phenomenon as an occasion for reassessing the central axiom of sociology that there is something distinctively `social' about human behaviour.",sociology

Caste groups are unequal, ranked on a scale of hierarchy on the basis of their ritual status, from pure to impure. The hierarchy is sanctioned by the Hindu religious belief.

Their outcomes, as such, are usually associated with the transition to modernity, the rise of capitalism, and the emergence of democracy. It is their transformative effect, despite similarities, that sets them apart from rebellions, revolts, political revolutions, and other types of social movements, making them rare events in history. Compared to political revolutions, which are typically orchestrated from above, social revolutions are mass based. Their root causes are structural in nature, and the processes associated with their mass mobilization typically involve cultural, psychological, and political factors. The systematic social scientific study of revolutions may be traced back to the 19th century. These early works accounted for the structural causes and social forces behind them. Some project a concern with the deleterious effects of revolutionary dynamics. In the context of 20th-century history, the events that followed the Russian Revolution spurred academic interest on this complex sociopolitical phenomenon. The first generation of scholarship on revolution may be identified as the “Natural History School.” Scholars writing in this vein in the 1930s identified common historical patterns through which the American, English, French, and Russian Revolutions unfolded. In this perspective, revolutions emerge as a “natural” historical outcome of old regime practices, and their outbreaks follow a sequence of historical events that culminate in the establishment of a new regime. Second-generation theorists writing in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s focused on psychological factors, in particular expectation and frustration mechanisms. Scholars belonging to this generation also paid attention to the effects of institutional imbalance (or systemic pathology) on the potential for revolution. Third-generation scholars, primarily writing in the 1970s and 1980s, developed structural explanations of revolution, claiming that the key to making sense of the causes of revolution requires the student of revolution to consider the nature of “state breakdown” and the revolutionary potential of lower classes. Scholars belonging to this generation also paid attention to the political processes in the development of revolution. Fourth-generation scholars aimed to highlight agency in their analyses, although not at the expense of structural explanations. These scholars, writing since the 1990s, have more concretely examined the role played by culture and ideology, the structural features of gender and race, and increasingly the emotional and storytelling dimensions of revolutionary processes. Since this last generation of scholars’ focus on cultural and structural factors, more recent work has increasingly paid attention to the connections between globalization and revolution.</p>",sociology

Sexuality studies are interdisciplinary and include work from anthropology, gender and women’s studies, history, LGBT studies, psychology, queer studies, and sociology. The social study of sexuality contrasts with biological approaches to human sexuality, which frame sexual expression as resulting from anatomy and hormones. Contemporary social approaches to studying sexualities—the focus of this article—took shape during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when sociologists, feminists, and gay liberationists argued that sexuality (desire, orientation) was not innate, but socially constructed. Thus, contemporary research and theory operates under the assumption that sexual desires, identities, and behaviors are socially constructed. Sexuality studies seek to explain how social institutions and social interaction patterns shape sexual meanings and practices. A significant portion of sexualities work focuses on inequalities between genders, between heterosexuals and nonheterosexuals (of which there are an expanding array of identities, particularly as gender identities expand), races and ethnicities, and social classes.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0111,"<p>Individuals are shaped by the multiple categories to which they are perceived to belong and the social structures that undergird systems of categorization. Systems of social categorization are virtually always associated with differential, unequal resources. Intersectionality is a concept fundamental to understanding these societal inequalities; the key assertion of intersectionality is that the various systems of societal oppression do not act independently of each other. Different systems of inequality are transformed in their intersections, the fundamental principle of intersectionality. The phrase “race, class, and gender,” still in use, is a precursor of the concept of intersectionality. The preferred use of the latter term reflects in part the awareness that there are more than three intersecting systems of societal inequalities. The metaphors noted in the section Metaphors of Intersectionality below have been powerful visualizations of this complexity. Further, some identities may be privileged categories, others marginalized. Thus oppression and privilege may be experienced simultaneously, complicating the analysis of inequality. These issues are addressed in the section Critiques of Intersectionality below. Intersectionality crosses levels of analysis, from the micro-level experiences of individual actors to the macro-level structural, organizational, and institutional contexts in which human interactions and experiences are formed. Intersectionality is an analytic approach, a way of thinking about social categories that articulates similarity and difference, always inflected by relations of power. Research adopting an intersectional lens falls into several not entirely distinct groups: theoretical and methodological debates, evident in the sections Organizational Frameworks of Intersectionality and Methodologies, and applications of intersectional dynamics and political interventions, evident in the sections Intersectional Praxis and Transnational Intersectionalities. Intersectionality is also a deeply interdisciplinary concept, an analytic approach that can be found in almost all of the social sciences as well as the humanities; examples here are drawn from political science and psychology, in addition to the sociological examples appropriate to this series.</p>",sociology

The article proposes a synthetic analysis of this change, starting with statistical data on the migration of populations from the poorest countries on Earth to the richest ones. The analysis focuses on what is happening in the vast area of the Mediterranean. The history of the Mediterranean, this is the hypothesis put forward in the article, could help us to reflect innovatively on the demographic and cultural dynamics that are taking place in a particularly significant way. The reason for which it is hypothesized that the Mediterranean could be the privileged social place where we can reflect on the metamorphosis we are experiencing lies in the long tradition of welcoming diversity and in the capacity for the coexistence of religions, cultures, and civilizations that, over the centuries, have been the force thanks to which the whole world has been dominated, despite the clashes that historiography has unquestionably shown us. The article shows the important commitment of the leaders of the different world religions in generating spaces for encounters and dialogue between cultural diversities that cannot be analyzed within the paradigm of confrontation but require to be understood within the paradigm of confrontation and responsible coexistence. The work done so far clearly shows the possibility of dialogue between diversities, as well as pointing the way forward to socialize all different cultures to be together, without clashing for dominance; in this task, the reflections of Pope Francis and Edgar Morin on the concepts of brotherhood and fraternity appear particularly useful.",sociology

This doctrine typically regards one’s own race as superior to other races. Intergroup hatred and discrimination generally accompanies racist doctrines. Social science investigates racism at three interrelated levels. First, individual racism involves those individuals who hold racist beliefs. Here racist ideas often overlap with such concepts as prejudice, xenophobia, bigotry, and intolerance. But the key distinguishing feature of individual racism is that the group differences are viewed as innate and unchangeable. If assimilation or conversion is viewed as possible, then intolerance is involved but not racism. Second, situational racism occurs when racist behavior is shaped by the social context. This occurs when face-to-face situations are patterned, based on racist beliefs, to place one group in an inferior position in intergroup interaction. This occurs, for example, when one racial group in a situation possesses most of the resources that emphasize the status differences between the groups. Finally, third, structural and cultural racism results when a society’s institutions are shaped by racist beliefs and results in group discrimination. Indeed, racism’s effects can invade virtually all of a society’s institutions. Thus, racism differentiates human beings from one another by presumed “races,” and this leads to unequal access to resources and opportunities as well as to other forms of inequality such as gender-, ethnic-, and class-based inequity. Much of the research on racism has focused on anti-Black racism in the United States; but non-American references with other racist targets are included.</p>",sociology

A closely related concept, “childhood,” refers to the life stage of these individuals. During the middle of the 20th century, sociologists generally were not focused on studying children, leaving that field to psychologists, who often studied children from the perspective of developmental psychology. Subsequently, three major streams of sociological thought began to develop. The first looked at how child development was conditioned by both historical and social circumstances. The second studied how children created their own worlds and were themselves active agents, rather than passive recipients of socialization. The third highlighted the importance of societal and family investment in children. For many researchers, scholarship from psychology, economics, and demography was combined with insights from sociology to provide new information on child well-being. As a consequence, several categories for entries in this article overlap conceptually. This means that entries logically could be listed under other subheadings or duplicated across these categories. A second definition of childhood suggests that it is a socially constructed life stage, with variations in how childhood is conceived both historically and cross-culturally.

Discrimination has been addressed by a wide range of disciplines as an explanatory object—including sociology, anthropology, political science, psychology, economics, and law—all seeking to shed light on why discrimination occurs and what conditions give rise to and reproduce its practice. What distinguishes a sociological approach to discrimination as an explanatory object from that in other disciplines, namely psychology or economics, is its insistence on looking at the macro level of analysis, explaining the phenomenon as a result of social processes not necessarily reducible to individual-level preferences or cognitive processes. Sociologists have also addressed discrimination as an explanation for an observed phenomenon of interest, namely social stratification: the unequal distribution of status, material benefits, and political rights.</p>",sociology

It bears the potential to reconnect the sociological discourse with the classical ‘big’ questions that haunted sociology for an entire century. But for shaping the global agenda of sociology, this essay argues, the sociological discourse in India first had to deconstruct its alter ego. Overcoming the reception of western sociology as a monolithic construct will remove an intellectual obstacle. This leitmotiv is discussed by reflecting on three recent books, by Yogesh Atal, T. K. Oommen and Yogendra Singh, which analyse the development of Indian sociology as a ‘locus of struggles’ (Bourdieu): Where did it come from? How does it operate? Where will it go? While tracing its evolution and interaction with western sociological discourse, the essay first discusses the introduction of social sciences to India as a colonial heritage that implanted empiricist ‘outsider ’ studies of ‘native’ cultures, and identifies the reception of the American siblings of structural-functionalism and empiricism that dominated western sociology in the 1960s. Both intellectual encounters provoked the traditionalist call for indigenization as a counterforce to the perceived westernization of Indian social thought from 1950 to 1980.

In contrast, it is argued that postmodernism already constitutes an international discourse and that recognition of the increasing significance of global transformations has opened up the analytical frame beyond modernity.

A willingness to tackle the dimension of space and the thorny problems it raises often sets rural sociologists apart from other sociologists. This research tradition contrasted with general sociology's concern with developing generalization, aspatial covering laws, and proto‐typical relationships of modern or Fordist development settings.

Different disciplines employ various approaches to address relationships. For instance, social psychologists seek universal properties in human relations. Sociologists, on the other hand, pay much attention to changes in family ties and social connections and how social structures and contexts (e.g., social class, race, gender, norms, and social policy) impact these relationships. Relationships have been a central research concern in sociology. Sociologists have been particularly interested in studies of intimate relationships, such as marriage and other familial ties. In sociology, social relationships are divided into primary and secondary groups. Primary ties are characterized by direct, personal, and intimate interactions. In addition, primary group members exchange tacit items such as support, love, and concern. Examples of these would be family ties and close friends. Secondary social groups, on the other hand, such as political parties and trade unions, are usually impersonal and instrumental and are formed to fulfill special interests.

While there is much consternation in the popular press about globalization generally and economic globalization specifically that suggests that something new and never before seen is taking place, social scientists across a handful of decades offer a more tempered view, depicting a functionally integrated global economy as an historical thing that nonetheless transforms and develops over time. The rich literature that has developed on this topic draws the readers’ attention to particular historical times and processes that constitute the early formations of the global economy we know today, even as its size and scope has intensified in recent decades. In this vein, scholars have devoted much attention to specifying the key indicators of economic globalization including—to name just a few— trade, global commodity chains, foreign direct investment, and financialization. All of these processes are the means by which economies are globally interwoven through the production, distribution, and circulation of goods, information, money, culture, and people. A similar amount of scholarly attention has examined the outcomes of economic globalization, and how they vary for different actors. Here inequalities of resources and power are central focal points, including those within and among nations, between capital and labor, and within the world-system hierarchy. The impact of economic globalization on marginalized people and places, as demarcated by gender, race, migration status, and environmental locations, as well as on nation-states and their capacity to govern effectively, are also topics of much interest. Finally, scholars have examined the many important issues related to the governance and regulation of economic globalization, which as a set of processes is occurring at a higher level than the nation-state and includes an ever-shifting balance of power between a number of actors and institutional bodies. International organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, are examples of quasi-governmental organizational bodies, though of varied effectiveness, as are international financial institutions.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0053,"<p>Broadly defined, social stratification is an important part of many areas of study in sociology, but it also constitutes a distinct field on its own. Simply put, social stratification is the allocation of individuals and groups according to various social hierarchies of differing power, status, or prestige. Although divisions are often based on gender, religion, or race and ethnicity, the present entry focuses largely on socioeconomic inequalities, for the most part leaving other forms of social inequality to other entries. In this regard, social stratification is found in every society, even if it takes on slightly different forms. Uncovering what accounts for differences in social stratification—among societies and within particular societies over time—is a long-standing goal of the field. The classic works of early stratification sociologists—spurred by the work of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim—tended to be concerned with the question of “why” and “how” stratification arose in the first place. Although this debate continues to be an underlying motivation for much research on stratification, empirical research typically tackles questions for which evidence is more tangible. By the 1950s, stratification research was increasingly concerned with social mobility, though mostly within individual countries. By the 1980s, explaining cross-national differences in stratification became an important goal of the field. By now, stratification research is characterized by several debates. Although it has received somewhat less attention in the past decade or so, a classic debate centers on how socioeconomic position should be measured. Emphasis here has been on the applicability of measures of social class, status, and prestige. Although there are certainly important exceptions, differences in approach generally fall along territorial lines. European sociologists have tended to focus on relevance of occupation-based measures of social class, while North American sociologists have tended to rely on measures of socioeconomic status, which incorporate education as well as occupation. There have also been debates regarding the most effective ways to measure class and socioeconomic status. Yet other debates center on the importance of incorporating race and gender in studies of stratification. Finally, in recent decades emphasis has moved to the importance of education, both as a source of stratification on its own, and how it affects economic inequalities.</p>",sociology

The only child of a peasant sharecropper turned postman, he left his region on the recommendation of a high school teacher to pursue an elite academic curriculum in Paris. He graduated from the prestigious École Normale Supérieure, then at the apex of French academic life. There he studied philosophy. He concentrated on epistemology and on the history of science, which set him against the then dominant current, existentialism, personified by Jean-Paul Sartre. Bourdieu’s vocation in philosophy shifted abruptly to the social sciences after he was drafted into the French army and sent to Algeria at the height of its Liberation War (1956–1962). There he turned to empirical inquiry, carrying out both ethnographic and statistical studies of colonial transformation, as well as absorbing the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss. Upon his return to France, Bourdieu completed his conversion to sociology: he became Director of Studies at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris (1964); he founded a research center (1968), launched a journal (Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales, 1975), and assembled a research team focusing on symbolic power, and social inequality in their broadest manifestations. After the 1970s, Bourdieu tackled an increasingly diverse set of empirical topics (spanning art, ritual, kinship, religion, science, intellectuals, language, social classes, and political institutions, inter alia) while developing his own paradigm, seeking a pathway out of the opposition between structuralist objectivism and constructivist subjectivism—first proposed in Outline of a Theory of Practice. He then honed his distinctive conceptual triad of habitus, capital, and field in Distinction (1984) before he was elected to the Collège de France in 1982, where his research expanded to encompass the state, gender domination, the social foundations of the economy, and the experience of social suffering in contemporary society. Bourdieu addressed salient social issues, as in The Weight of the World (1999), and deepened his rethinking of the distinctive logic of practice and the epistemological dilemmas of social inquiry in Pascalian Meditations (2000). He became a leading public figure in the global mobilization against neoliberalism, while his work gained international influence across the social sciences and the humanities. At the time of his sudden death in 2002, he was working on a “general theory of fields.”</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0110,"<p>Defining the meaning of motherhood is more complex than once thought. Due to technological and legal changes there is more and more variation among mothers with respect to age, marital status, and sexual orientation. Adoption has long shown that social motherhood is not contingent on giving birth, and surrogacy and in vitro fertilization now create a possible distinction between the gestational mother and the genetic mother. As a result, the very definition of who is a mother can be contentious. The very process of conception, pregnancy, and birthing has undergone much transition, with much greater involvement of medical professionals. The meanings associated with motherhood and motherhood practices vary across historical, sociocultural, and political contexts. Despite the great variation, even within specific countries at one point in time in the practices of motherhood, discourses about what exactly constitutes “good” mothering and who should and should not mother exist. Those at the “frontier” of motherhood, such as queer mothers, continue to shape and reshape the very concept of motherhood and mothering. For many mothers this means they are caught between cultural expectations on how to mother and the realities of their everyday life: for example, breastfeeding practices and childcare arrangements. Although rates of mothers’ labor-force participation are high or increasing in many countries, mothers still face the primary burden of arranging, managing, and even financing childcare solutions for their children; work-family conflict remains a problem for mothers much more so than for fathers. Polices designed to ease the conflict between employment and motherhood, both those implemented by governments and those created by employers, vary greatly across countries, which reemphasizes the context dependency of the meaning of motherhood for women’s lives. Many aspects of research on motherhood suggest that motherhood, and especially the link between motherhood and employment continues to be an important component of persistent gender inequality. In addition to contributing to inequalities between men and women, and between women within any given society, motherhood also contributes to global inequality (through the transnational market for care workers), international adoptions, and international surrogacy.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0193,"<p>Popular culture is the set of practices, beliefs, and objects that embody the most broadly shared meanings of a social system. It includes media objects, entertainment and leisure, fashion and trends, and linguistic conventions, among other things. Popular culture is usually associated with either mass culture or folk culture, and differentiated from high culture and various institutional cultures (political culture, educational culture, legal culture, etc.). The association of popular culture with mass culture leads to a focus on the position of popular culture within a capitalist mode of economic production. Through this economic lens, popular culture is seen as a set of commodities produced through capitalistic processes driven by a profit motive and sold to consumers. In contrast, the association of popular culture with folk culture leads to a focus on subcultures such as youth cultures or ethnic cultures. Through this subculture lens, popular culture is seen as a set of practices by artists or other kinds of culture makers that result in performances and objects that are received and interpreted by audiences, both within and beyond the subcultural group. Holistic approaches examine the ways that popular culture begins as the collective creation of a subculture and is then appropriated by the market system. Key issues in the sociological analysis of popular culture include the representation of specific groups and themes in the content of cultural objects or practices, the role of cultural production as a form of social reproduction, and the extent to which audiences exercise agency in determining the meanings of the culture that they consume.</p>",sociology

The methodological issue for sociology is perhaps less to do with a numeric deficit and more to do with a lack of student interest in the use of quantitative methods.

How do, and how should, the social sciences, and particularly sociology, react to these pathologies of late modernity?

10.1177/1468795x241296085,"Gregor McLennan sees my book as inaugurating a new phase of “multiplex” postcolonial sociology. This approach moves away from sweeping generalizations about Eurocentrism, Manicheaism, complicity, and pervasive coloniality in “Western” sociology. It pays closer attention to sociology’s internal heterogeneity and is less distrustful of scientific norms such as validity, objectivity, evidence, autonomy, scientific neutrality, and explanation. More specifically, my approach relies (1) on the idea of “context” from the classic sociology of knowledge and intellectual history; (2) on the concept of “field” from Bourdieu; (3) on methods of “close reading” and textual interpretation from literary criticism; and (4) on the “historians’ craft” (Bloch) of using the most extensive available archive of published and unpublished sources. I argue that we can evaluate historical thinkers in their contexts, assessing the constraints and spaces of possibility they faced, and then examine their intellectual choices, the moves they make in the social scientific game. This approach aligns more closely with the ideas of the founders of postcolonial theory, who were more interested in texts that “brush up unstintingly against historical constraints” rather than those that are “inertly of their time” (Edward Said). McLennan agrees that postcolonial sociology is indebted to European Enlightenment traditions; I focus on its roots in the sociology of knowledge and sociological historicism. The article then responds to McLennan’s main “probes.” The first concerns the methodological problem of “labeling investigations as ʽsociologyʼ and specific people as ʽsociologistsʼ”, and the limits of field theory. The second concerns my “outline of a theory of colonial sociological practice,” which tries to understand the dilemmas facing sociologists in colonial situations and the historians who study them. The third probe addresses the question of the scientific exploitation of empire. The sociologists I emphasize did not approach the colonized as a pool of resources to be extracted and exploited but worked across the colonial boundary line to generate knowledge. Although the book focuses on the mid-20th century, I return in my comments to Durkheim, upon whose shoulders so much of the later work was standing. The key is that Durkheim was also a theorist of empire and colonialism and politically an anticolonialist. He described colonies as anomic spaces and rejected biological concepts and hierarchical notions of civilization. He rejected universalistic values while advocating a system of states governed by historically specific morality and law rather than violence. Finally, Durkheim reversed the “imperial gaze,” directing it back at Europe.",sociology

I further discuss the extent to which ‘futurelessness’ is a particular mode of relating to and feeling about the future that is characteristic of contemporary European societies.

But despite the large number of individual studies inspired by France's increasing urbanization, no real urban sociology had been built up. This is now gradually coming into existence through an accumulation of recent or current studies, some directed towards theoretical research, others guided by more immediate practical considerations (such as the problems of town-planning).  In actual fact, urban sociology seems unlikely to develop, in France, into a specialized branch of sociology.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0099,"<p>Housework contributes to the broad project of social reproduction. Household labor perpetuates the social structures associated with family, gender, inequality and the labor force. Provisioning families and keeping up the household all fall under the general rubric of non-market labor, that is, the unpaid work that includes not only housework, but also caring for family members. Because this takes place outside public view and falls largely to women, the value of housework to families and society has often been overlooked or discounted. Until the middle of the 20th century, household labor received little scholarly attention outside the applied field of home economics. As female employment rates increased, however, men’s and women’s lives converged in the realm of paid work, raising questions about why change came more slowly to private households. Although men do more work around the house than their fathers did a generation ago, women still do the lion’s share, and some chores remain stubbornly stereotyped as “women’s work.” Indeed, the allocation of housework is a telling indicator of gender inequality in individual households and societies. Housework also reflects on class inequality, because high-income women can hire poor women to do the job. Domestic arrangements are the outcome of both micro-level family circumstances and macro-level cultural and structural forces. Gender attitudes, partners’ time constraints, their relative resources in bargaining over the chores, and the presence of children illustrate the micro-level influences on the volume and distribution of housework. Cross-national differences in domestic practices demonstrate that the characteristics of social institutions and social policies shape intimate domestic arrangements. How the housework is managed matters for marital relationships, personal well-being, individual careers and population processes. The demand for household labor has created a transnational labor force of domestic workers with implications for global inequality.</p>",sociology

Methodologically, it privileges deep, immersive fieldwork alongside research participants. Substantively, it focuses on interactions and institutions that define urban space, whether those are public streets, neighborhood organizations, or community events. Urban ethnographies have traditionally thought of “communities” geographically, examining how the central topics of poverty, crime, culture, and peer group formation play out in delimited spaces such as neighborhoods, wards, and districts. Theoretically, it has historically tended to draw on social-constructionist and interactionist orientations, conceiving of the urban life as something “built up,” so to speak, from repeated and ritualized encounters. As one of the longest-standing and iconic subfields of sociology, anthropology, and other humanistic social sciences, urban ethnography remains one of the most influential modes of understanding social life in cities. True to form as one of the most conflictual and controversial subfields, an increasing number of scholars are pushing back on convention, insisting on the need to embrace theoretical orientations that are more critical and structurally focused, and to more adequately consider the global forces and relational dynamics that exist beyond, but fatefully impinge upon, bounded field sites.

As an academic discipline, social policy is distinct in its empirical focus on welfare provision but overlaps with other social science fields such as sociology, political science, and public administration. From a narrow standpoint, social policy refers to policies and practices created to address the needs of individuals, i.e., to provide welfare. From a broader standpoint, social policy can be used to motivate individual behavior; is inherently related to the creation of social inequalities across class, gender, race, and sexualities; and is closely tied to capital. Social policy encompasses a wide range of policies, including activation, care, education, families, health care, pensions/aging, poverty/social assistance, and unemployment. Social policy practice refers to the administration of social policies and service delivery. Welfare provision is not limited to government—markets, employers, nongovernmental organizations, churches, and informal networks all play a role in welfare provision, although this varies across countries. The focus, however, particularly in social policy research, is often on government policies and the provision of services. In particular, social policy is often discussed in relation to the welfare state because social policies represent the public or collective management of social risks, an essential function of welfare states. In recent years, social policy research has become increasingly comparative, with a focus on cross-national analyses of systems, policies, and service provision.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0270,"<p>This collection of studies brings together research covering different forms of economic inequality as they exist in a cross-national perspective. Existing work in this area examines income disparities between countries (often characterized by the familiar North-South gap in development), as well as the distribution of income within countries (as is often summarized by the Kuznets Curve or the Great U-Turn). Some of this work is descriptive, examining how levels of development or inequality vary across countries and/or how these levels change over time. Much of it, however, attempts to identify causal factors that contribute to a country’s economic growth, underdevelopment, or changes in its income distribution. Scholars develop models that either focus on internal conditions (institutions, geography, state policy) or external forces (different forms of economic globalization, including international trade, foreign investment, and aid). There has been considerable debate among scholars as to whether income differences between countries are narrowing (i.e., the convergence literature) or not. Less attention is given to whether income distributions among countries are becoming more similar (convergence in inequality levels). In addition, some scholars combine these two pieces of information (i.e., inequality between and within countries) to study world income inequality, with a similar emphasis on description; causal explanation (examining internal and external factors); and debate over whether or not convergence is occurring. Related work examines how national income inequality influences economic growth, intergenerational mobility, poverty, health, violence, and human rights conditions. Theoretically, excessive inequality is thought to slow growth, hinder mobility, and concentrate a greater number of people below the poverty line. A number of scholars design empirical studies that test these assumptions, however, producing results that often confirm these assumptions, but that also offer qualifications to help nuance these arguments. Finally, scholars are now turning their attention to the distribution of wealth, a more immense type of inequality, but one that remains understudied due to the lack of data coverage across time and space. Although this line of research remains in its infancy, scholars should eventually be able to replicate the vast literature on income inequality with a research agenda focused entirely on the global distribution of wealth (and its components parts that exist within and between countries), as well as related work on intergenerational mobility and household poverty as it pertains to asset accumulation.</p>",sociology

The social relations of work, whether directly or through their economic impact, shape every aspect of our existence. To discuss labor globally might come close to requiring a discussion of everything. Understandings of capitalism as a global system, and perceptions of labor’s orientation as necessarily internationalist, also go back at least to Marx and Engel’s Communist Manifesto and the First International. This article limits its ambition by concentrating on important claims of transformation (roughly) since the 1970s. After introducing some general overviews in the next section, the article is organized (somewhat arbitrarily) into three related themes. The first theme involves claims of globalization as a spatial reorganization, with sections introducing literature on globalization as responsible for a labor’s disempowerment, especially in the (Global) North, works on global value chains, and works on labor in the (Global) South. The second theme involves claims of the emergence of a “new economy” as a social transformation of labor markets, work and workplaces, and changing prospects for labor’s agency and strategy. Here the sections consider “big-picture” claims of the division of labor and economic transformation, more qualified depictions noting continuities and possibilities for labor resistance, and more-specific literatures on the proliferation of precarious labor and the connections between free and unfree labor. Finally, the third theme considers the implications for labor organizing. Typically, attention focuses either on the need for labor internationalism or on new strategies more appropriate to the new economy. The emphasis on depictions of restructuring in the last few decades and rethinking labor’s situation means that not only the long history but also several modern issues are dealt with only in passing. Perhaps most conspicuously, more could be said of labor migration, which is covered in an existing article; see the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Sociology article “Immigration.” Similarly, although several listed texts emphasize the gendered nature of change and the connections between paid and unpaid labor, readers should also see the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Sociology article “Women’s Employment and Economic Inequality between Households.” This article also largely avoids referring to country-specific studies, although many of the most influential early texts based their analyses of change on the United States.</p>",sociology

Sexuality is undeniably shaped by gender as an individual, interpersonal, and institutional force. It is also shaped by intersecting axes of difference including class, race, ethnicity, age, and body morphology or disability status. These are in turn also affected by sexuality. The study of gendered sexuality has been an interdisciplinary undertaking. The sociological field incorporates insights from anthropology, feminist philosophy, gender and women’s studies, history, LGBTQIA+ studies, cultural studies, media studies, psychology, and queer studies. Early sociology failed to recognize sexuality as a domain of social study, so the subject only gained relevance in sociology in the second half of the 20th century. Touchstone texts from the subfield’s formation often draw on non-sociological works as well as biological, medical, and psychoanalytic approaches. Newer advances in the study of sexuality were initially spurred by feminisms and activist-scholars from the lesbian, bisexual, and gay liberation movement. As such, alongside theoretical development and empirical study, some work in the discipline retains a normative approach, seeking to clarify and advance varying definitions of sexual liberation. Contemporary sociological research on sexuality focuses on resultant inequalities: whether between genders (mostly still conceived of as either men and women) between sexual orientations (mostly still understood as either straight or gay) or between different races or ethnicities. As such, sociological study on sexualities focuses on the collective consequences of sexuality as a varied and changing institutional and normative force.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0199,"<p>Ever since the emergence of sociology as a discipline, sociologists have shown an interest in paid work. Marx, Weber, and Durkheim’s interest in societal changes was inspired by the rise of market relations and paid work. The classical sociologists studied the growth and spread of paid work in relation to the development of inequality, rationalization, and social cohesion. Since then, the form and content of employment relationships has changed substantially and keeps on changing. The continued interest of sociologists in these developments has culminated in a well-established field of research. This article explores that field of research in three parts. The first part of the bibliography lists textbooks, reference manuals, journals, and national research traditions. The field shows substantial variety due to the constant development of the labor market and employment relations, and due to institutional differences in the architecture of employment relations. The second part of the article focuses on developments in paid work. The following themes are explored: the growth of paid work relationships, the increase in the number of paid work hours, the major changes in the architecture of employment relationships, the effects of paid work relationships on the well-being of workers, and the development of work values and work-hour preferences. The third part focuses on different labor market positions. This section starts with the standard employment relationship and then moves on to its counterpart: unemployment. It continues with workers in nonstandard positions, such as temporary jobs, part-time jobs, jobs with irregular and long work hours, and self-employed workers.</p>",sociology

Transnational adoption changed ideas around family and kinship as children were not only being adopted cross-nationally but also cross-racially. Because transnational adoption quickly began to transgress the race-matching procedures that guided initial intercountry and domestic adoptions, this new form of family making drew both public attention and research interests. This article primarily focuses on transnational adoption to the United States and the controversies, politics, and outcomes surrounding it. Initial research studies in the 1960s and 1970s in social work and psychology began with a focus largely on children’s psychological and social adjustment into their adoptive families before continuing across disciplines such as law; gender and family studies; cultural studies; and sociology. As research continued, attention reflected disciplinary foci expanding from outcome studies to examinations of the effect of policies, politics (domestic and geopolitical), and race, class, and gender. Given the growth of transnational adoption globally, in 1995 the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption entered into force with the goal of securing the “best interests of the child” and preventing child trafficking and other abuses. In recent decades, new sending countries have open and closed relatively quickly, though China remains a major sending country to the United States for the past two decades, while longer-standing sending countries such as Korea have changed their policies, resulting in decreased adoptions to the United States. These changes, along with a growing awareness of the inequalities inherent in transnational adoption and increased consideration for first families, raise new research questions around the future of adoption.</p>",sociology

Racial categorization has primarily been simplistic, essentialist, and typological in nature, forcing people to “fit” into categories that do not necessarily reflect their ethnic or national heritage. The process of racialization has shifted racial boundaries, depending on sociopolitical pressures for inclusion into particular racial groups or even the systematic exclusion of people due to social forces such as war or labor market pressures. Racism is a byproduct of racial categorization that focuses on the hierarchical arrangement of various racial groups.

Burawoy provides a novel justification for advocacy scholarship in sociology. Public sociology is intended to have political effects, but also to be funded by the politically neutral state. He argues that public sociology is institutionally neutral, but that committing to an organic relation with a social movement is legitimate as a matter of the sociologist's personal value choice. Although this produces side-taking sociology, by improving the case for particular standpoints it ser ves to improve democratic discussion generally, which is an appropriately neutral public aim.",sociology

In some countries, more than one in five residents were not born in the country where they live, while the economies of other countries are heavily dependent on the money that migrants send back. Migration thus affects a wide range of societies around the globe and can affect almost all aspects of human life. Sociologists consequently seek to explain population movements and state policies of migration control, debate theories of integration across a range of human activities, and consider the consequences of migration for development, national identities, and conceptions of membership in a world increasingly characterized by human relationships that span the borders of contemporary nation-states. Sociologists who work on migration do so in conversation with scholars drawn from many disciplines, including anthropology, demography, economics, ethnic studies, geography, history, legal studies, and political science. Given that the sociological field of migration studies is fundamentally interdisciplinary, any bibliography must be multidisciplinary, and it will invariably provide only a very small snapshot of the whole. The snapshot below, to remain manageable, is restricted to English-language publications, and it provides greater coverage of the US case than of other countries or regions of the world.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0084,"<p>“Social closure” is one of the most basic terms and concepts in sociology. Basically, closure refers to processes of drawing boundaries, constructing identities, and building communities in order to monopolize scarce resources for one’s own group, thereby excluding others from using them. Society is not a homogenous entity but is instead internally structured and subdivided by processes of social closure. Some social formations, such as groups, organizations, or institutions, may be open to everybody, provided they are capable of participation, while access to most others is limited due to certain criteria that either allow people to become members or exclude them from membership. Therefore, social closure is a ubiquitous, everyday phenomenon that can be observed in almost every sphere and place in the social world. Members of societies experience closure from the very beginning of their social life. To be excluded from certain groups starts at school, where presumably homogenous classes begin to subdivide into distinct peer groups or sports teams. Here, exclusion may be rather arbitrary, but the experience of having a door slammed in one’s face proceeds in cases, where inclusion depends on formal rules or preconditions. Access to private schools follows explicit rules and depends on financial capacities; access to university depends on a certificate or diploma, eventually from certain schools only; membership in a highly prestigious club depends on economic and social capital and the respective social networks; and finally, in the case of migration, people will have to be eligible for citizenship and pass the thorny path of naturalization. However, it is not just the enormous plurality of forms that makes social closure crucial for sociology. Rather, the process of closure of social relations—of groups, organizations, institutions, and even national societies—is the fundamental process of both “communal” (Vergemeinschaftung) and “associative” relationships (Vergesellschaftung), and neither would be possible without social closure. In this broad and fundamental sense, social closure is not restricted to processes in national societies. It even allows for understanding crucial processes of the way the social world is organized at the regional or global level.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0229,"<p>Theoretically, the term “doing gender” first appeared in Harold Garfinkel’s case study of the intersexual Agnes in 1967, as an appendix to Garfinkel 1967 (cited under General Overview). The term was then discussed in Kessler and McKenna 1978 (cited under General Overview). The authors drew from Erving Goffman’s social constructionist theory of performance in establishing, first, the difference between sex and gender, and second, how gender was something people actively constructed in their daily lives. The provocation was therefore that if people were responsible for “doing” gender then they could also be held accountable for “undoing” gender. The book, however, was obscured by the proliferation of research regarding sex roles, rather than gender constructions. So, the concept of “doing gender” remained underground for a while, until it resurfaced in 1987 in the well-known paper of the same name written by American sociologists Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman (West and Zimmerman 1987, cited under General Overview). According to these authors, “doing” gender is defined as involving the everyday performance of “a complex of socially guided perceptual, interactional, and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of masculine and feminine ‘natures.’ When we view gender as an accomplishment, an achieved property of situated conduct, our attention shifts from matters internal to the individual and focuses on interactional and, ultimately, institutional arenas” (p. 126). West and Zimmerman were primarily focused on understanding how people created gender differences, rather than merely “gender.” Unlike Kessler and McKenna, who discussed the applicability of doing gender in transsexualism, West and Zimmerman finely combed the differences between “sex,” “sex category,” and “gender.” Following on from this, Deutsch 2007 together with Connell 2010 (both cited under Critiques of Doing Gender) critiqued this concept and proposed the “redoing of gender.” For example, Connell’s research uncovered that for transpeople, doing gender entailed “experiences that fit better under either the rubric of undoing gender or of redoing gender,” that transpeople “often attempted to meld together masculine and feminine gender performances” (p. 39), and that “many resisted these pressures by adapting a hybrid gender style of interacting with others. These acts constitute moments of ‘chipping away’ at the established gender order” (pp. 42–43). In addition, Judith Butler (see Butler 2004, cited under Critiques of Doing Gender) was more interested in exploring how gender could be undone, and defines this undoing as escaping “gender as a kind of a doing, an incessant activity performed . . . an improvisation within a scene of constraint” (p. 3) by underlining the “paradox of autonomy, a paradox that is heightened when gender regulations work to paralyze gendered agency at various levels” (p. 101). From this perspective, there are limits to how much agency individuals can have in performing gender. As such and inadvertently, social actors also undo gender when they relate to each other: “Despite one’s best efforts, one is undone, in the face of the other, by the touch, by the scent, by the feel, by the prospect of the touch, by the memory of the feel. And so, when we speak about my sexuality or my gender, as we do (and as we must) we mean something complicated by it” (p. 19). Butler’s focus on embodiment definitively pushed the debate further by critically assessing the usefulness of considering gender as an activity and asking sociologists to consider the ontological implication of the performativity of gender in relation to its mere performance. Her work is important because it clearly underlined the neglect of feminist studies to focus more on transgender identities, thereby sparking the growth of a specific area of knowledge known today as “queer theory.” In response to these developments, “doing gender” was further developed by West and Zimmerman 2009 (cited under General Overview), a celebratory symposium published twenty-two years after West and Zimmerman 1987 to assess the more recent applicability of this term in the field of gender studies. Methodologically, searching for resources on the theme of “doing gender” has focused on the performance of gender and on the domains of research to which it has been applied so far, as indicated by the specific headings in this article, while considering as well the “undoing of gender” and its performativity. Not all experts in the field would agree with this organization. However, it is important to specify the many ways in which the influential concept has branched out and deeply affected the field of gender studies. Therefore, the reader will notice a running consideration in the papers selected for this entry, with both the doing and the undoing of gender across a variety of areas: in education and at work, across cultures and intersectionally, in relation to emotions and in personal life (where a distinction was made again between parenting and romantic coupling and partnership), for youth health, and beyond the binary. This way of organizing the material falls in line with the most recent developments in the field. A simple search on the Web of Science database of the words “doing gender” within the publications category and in the topics of “Sociology” and “Women’s studies” between 1987 (when West and Zimmerman first published their paper) and 2019 reveals a total of 866 resources. Therefore, as not all resources could be included, the ones that appear in this entry were selected based on relevance, recency of publication, number of citations, prominence in the field, and methodological innovation (such as doing gender in visual sociology, or anthologies that focus on diverse cultural examples). The scope was meant to be relevant, versatile, approachable, and useful to teachers, researchers, and interested students. Nonetheless, there is the limitation that only English-language resources are included. The General Overview section is focused on the development of the term “doing gender” in theory and research, including the original paper discussed in this section and others published in a symposium, while the section on Critiques of Doing Gender presents a series on ongoing critiques to the concept of “doing gender.”</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0267,"<p>While cities have existed for millennia, it wasn’t until the advent of industrialization in the late eighteenth century that the world entered a process of mass urbanization. Sociology has been preoccupied with understanding the nature of urban life since then. Yet since the turn of the twenty-first century, sociologists, geographers, and urban studies scholars have begun noting that the voluminous literature on cities and urban life produced over a century of research and theorizing is almost exclusively based on the metropolitan experience of big cities in the Global North. Emerging literature on small cities has identified several trends that have rendered them nearly invisible to urban sociology. In their search for generalizable knowledge, sociologists have prioritized big cities as the best indicators of urbanity, creating seemingly universal categories of urban analysis that often hide, instead of illuminate, the urban dynamics of small cities. This focus has also created a false sense that most urban dwellers live in the metropolis. In the United States, the majority of the urban population lives in cities with less than 250,000 inhabitants, making them the modal form of urban life, while big cities like NYC, LA, and Chicago are the exception. That said, while drawing attention to small cities as a distinct category of urban research, sociologists have nonetheless struggled to define what constitutes a “small city.” One difficulty stems from sizeism, or the inability to draw clear boundaries based on population size. While “incorporated areas with less than 100,000 residents” is often used as a shorthand, urban characteristics do not suddenly change once such an arbitrary population number is surpassed. Another difficulty is the relativeness of “small” in global context: a Chinese city of 700,000 could be considered small in that context, but not elsewhere. Despite these definitional challenges, this scholarship maintains that renewed attention to small cities should bring tangible benefits to urban sociology at large. Small cities do not represent a lack of, deviant, or antagonistic forms of urbanity; they constitute an important node within the diverse modes of urbanity. Their urban problems may be recognizable to big cities, but often operate through a different set of variables within the small city context. This encyclopedia entry summarizes this corrective turn to the big city bias, outlines existing research on small(er) cities, and underscores growing calls for giving small cities their due attention.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0166,"<p>Social Darwinism is a complex and controversial topic, a package of ideologies supposedly inspired by biological evolutionism that is of interest to scholars of both the life and the social sciences. In principle it includes any political system inspired by the view that human nature and social activity are driven by our biological nature, especially as defined by the process of evolution. The complexity of the topic derives from the fact that the term social Darwinism has been applied to a number of different (and to some extent incompatible) ideologies. The key feature is supposed to be the influence of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, in which the “struggle for existence” determines the “survival of the fittest,” thereby ensuring that the species adapts to new conditions—although it is widely assumed that the process also guarantees progress toward higher levels of complexity. The classic image is of the proponents of unrestrained free-enterprise capitalism justifying their policy by appealing to the “survival of the fittest.” But the term has also been applied to justifications of militarism and imperialism (national or racial struggle) and to the eugenics movement’s efforts to replace natural selection with a process of artificial selection by restricting the reproduction of the “unfit.” The term has also been applied to more or less any claim that human nature is fixed by hereditary factors, especially those linked to social class or race. The topic is contentious because social Darwinism is almost always used in a pejorative sense—the opponents of these ideologies use it to define positions they reject, and this becomes particularly sensitive when applied to areas such as Nazi racial policies and the Holocaust. Most forms of social Darwinism are associated with right-wing ideologies, despite the fact that scholars can point to many left-wing writers who were also inspired by Darwin. The problem of interpretation is compounded by the fact that historians of both the biological and the social sciences are involved, bringing very different interpretive frameworks to bear. Scholars interested in the social world tend to equate social Darwinism with any ideology based on the struggle for existence, whether or not there is evidence of inspiration from biological Darwinism. Historians of science may be well aware that the term refers to a much wider range of ideologies than those inspired directly by Darwin, but they do expect the analysis to respect the fact that other biological ideas and, indeed, other evolutionary mechanisms were involved.</p>",sociology

Growth interests, it argues, especially dominate in countries like the United States, where land and buildings operate as private markets, rather than held in common by government or some other entity; most studies have been US based but many commentaries and analyses have followed on from research elsewhere. Researchers describe pursuit of growth in payrolls, capital spending, or construction activity. As in the classic Marxian framework, such would enhance “exchange value.” In the political sphere, growth interests form up at nested scales where they pressure for advantageous zoning and public infrastructure investments at relevant administrative levels—in roads, sewer lines, and so forth. They lobby and help finance campaigns. Opposition forms up, in turn, from those whose interest in the city is primarily for home life or shared enhancements—represented by civic groups or, increasingly, environmental organizations. They strive for gains, again from the extended Marxian lexicon, in “use value”—substantive public benefits, as in health care, libraries, schools, safety, and parks. The resulting debates, studies, and applications are subjects of hundreds of articles, reviews, and books.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0233,"<p>As communication technologies develop and as organizations create policies to deal with global expansion and work−life balance, work practices and organizational lives have shifted, giving rise to a model of work where employment is not restricted to one particular place or to standard work hours. This model, workplace flexibility, has been the topic of many fields including sociology, organizational psychology, industry relations, gender studies, management, and health research. This article brings together influential studies from these fields and identifies key themes and topics of interest: the institutional and organizational forces that drive demand for workplace flexibility, types and practices of flexibility, disparities in the provision, access to, and usage of flexibility, the impact of flexibility on work-, family-, and health-related outcomes, and variation in these outcomes by workers’ characteristics and across contexts. Only articles published in English are included, but great efforts have been made to include as many international and cross-national studies as possible. As will be seen, research findings on workplace flexibility are not always consistent. Indeed, despite a growing literature that praises work flexibility for accommodating employees’ needs to balance work, leisure, and family and for reducing gender inequalities, there are also studies criticizing flexibility for fueling heightened job demands and job insecurity and for enlarging gender inequalities. This contradiction can be partially addressed by realizing that researchers do not always define “workplace flexibility” in the same way (see more discussion in Types of Workplace Flexibility). Unless noted otherwise, this article defines workplace flexibility as the ability of workers to make choices regarding when, where, and for how long they engage in work-related tasks. Flexible work arrangements, therefore, are organizational practices that permit employees to adjust their work schedule or location to better manage demands outside of work. Rigorous studies—through group-randomized trials or natural experiments—show that flexibility can promote employer and employee outcomes, but only through a systematic cultural change in how work is defined and how workers are rewarded. Given the still prevalent ideal worker norms that expect workers to be highly dedicated to work and that use “time at work” as the sole metric to assess productivity, a more profound change is needed to remove the stigma around flexibility so as to provide viable solutions to contemporary employees’ needs.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0121,"<p>Conversation analysis (hereafter CA) is a rigorously empirical approach to the investigation of social action—or “talk-in-interaction,” to employ the term which has been adopted as the preferred description of the field—which has emerged in the last five decades as the distinctive research program within the wider ethnomethodological perspective. The core premise of CA is that the topic of social interaction per se has been virtually ignored by mainstream social science disciplines and that through the detailed inspection of transcriptions of recordings of conduct in naturally occurring social settings we are able to appreciate the complex forms of order and organization which constitute this bedrock of spoken interaction—the substrate upon which all the institutions of society inescapably depend. The primary aim of CA is to document this order and the systematic methods or practices which human actors rely upon to carry out their everyday social lives. As with its progenitor, ethnomethodology, it is difficult to apply standard scientific categories—theory, method, research design, etc.—to CA. Rather than pursue the testing of hypotheses derived from a priori theorizing, CA favors a more inductive approach to theory building based on the close inspection of actual sequences of conduct. By the same token, although CA does have methodological principles and procedures it is not something that can be utilized in a decontextualized fashion as, for example, an alternative to traditional thematic techniques for analyzing the content of verbal data such as recorded interviews. Since its emergence in the mid-1960s, there have been a number of developments in its core foci. Although the organization of ordinary or mundane conversational interaction still continues to receive scholarly attention, a significant amount of research activity is now undertaken into the talk which transpires in institutional or work-related settings. In addition, many commentators now identify two strands within CA. The first, which has become consolidated as the principal mode of CA research, is concerned with the structural organization of talk and the actions which particular sequences of turns accomplish. The second strand deals with the way descriptions of the social world are made in talk and the categories and commonsense knowledge which are constitutive parts of this process (see Membership Categorization Analysis). Although prominent in the early CA writings, this strand is now less conspicuous. CA is now firmly established within the social sciences. Although its roots are in sociology, the CA approach now informs a great deal of the research work in cognate fields such as linguistics, communication, anthropology, social psychology, education and child development, human-computer interaction, counseling, and psychotherapy.</p>",sociology

While much of this research focuses on the experiences of marginalized people (gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and other identities), critical attention has also been paid to the social construction of heterosexual or straight identities. Theoretical perspectives from fields like queer theory and psychology have informed this thinking, and activism and research specifically from queer theory has significantly influenced how researchers understand sexual identities. Intersections with other identities are also critical to understanding sexual identities, and much forward-thinking work on sexual identities examines gender, race, class, and ability simultaneously. This bibliography outlines research on sexual identity, beginning with key sources like Journals, Edited Volumes, and Online and Popular Sources. The Theoretical Foundations section includes classic works, best for those seeking an introduction to the field. The Studying Identity: Research Methods section addresses how sexual identities might be best studied, as well as ongoing methodological challenges. Also included are sections discussing how sexual identities have been defined, including histories of sexual identities, intersections with other identities and changing identity categories, research on sexual identity and the self, research that examines the relationship between sexual identity and behavior, and works discussing how sexual identities are understood in relationships and religion. Sections addressing collective sexual identities and identities in spaces examine how identities are used in social movements and how sexual identities shape and are shaped by communities. Finally, a section focused on the political economy of sexual identities addresses the relationships between sexualities, nations, economies, and policy. While the bulk of this bibliography focuses on sexual identities within the United States, sources examining sexual identities in a variety of national and transnational contexts are included in a number of sections.</p>",sociology

A vast majority of scholarship dealing with gender inequality focuses on women and the ways that they are structurally and systematically subordinated to men and disadvantaged. Scholars of inequality note, however, that there are two sides to inequality: disadvantage and privilege. Masculinities scholars study the various ways that men are—as a group—privileged, as well as focusing on the costs of those privileges and the ways in which not all men are granted equal access to them. “Masculinity” refers to the behaviors, social roles, and relations of men within a given society as well as the meanings attributed to them. The term masculinity stresses gender, unlike male, which stresses biological sex. Thus studies of masculinities need not be confined to biological males. Masculinity studies is a feminist-inspired, interdisciplinary field that emerged in the last few decades of the 20th century as a topic of study. It deals with the diversity of identities, behaviors, and meanings that occupy the label masculine and does not assume that they are universal. Thus scholars of masculinity often refer to masculinities in the plural to highlight the diversity of meanings, roles, and behaviors consumed in the term. Despite the fact that gender is often experienced as intensely personal—an internal facet of our identity—masculinities are produced and reproduced through the course of our daily interactions as well as within the larger institutions of society. This bibliography provides resources and an introductory overview of historical studies of masculinity, theories of masculinity and gender inequality, the relationship between masculinity and sexuality, the literature dealing with diverse men’s movements, and a summary of findings within various social institutions (education, the family, the workplace, sport, and the media).</p>",sociology

Sociologists up until the last quarter of the 20th century assumed that religion was in the process of a slow death—a process called “secularization.” Sociologists now see secularization as occurring only in certain parts of social life, opening the door to the study of the religious influences on a range of social behaviors such as immigration, race relations, and politics. For example, some scholars have asked why immigrants are more religious than others. Other sociologists continue to study religion itself in congregations, or as systems of belief. For example, some sociologists have asked why American religion is increasingly individualistic. American sociologists of religion have remained focused on religion in America and have made limited forays into other parts of the world.

Positive, in Comte’s sense, meant abandoning absolute for relative truth, and the search for the real nature or cause of things, in favor of discovering laws, defined as predictable regularities in the behavior of observable phenomena. Comte’s sociology, divided into statics (laws of social order) and dynamics (laws of historical progress), was integral to his wider positivist system. Its founding completed the “encyclopedic scale” of the fundamental sciences (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, sociology) and made finally possible, he claimed, both a scientific politics and an all-embracing positive philosophy that was destined—following the “law of three states”—to supersede previous worldviews based on theology and metaphysics, together with their corresponding societal forms. Positive philosophy, complemented after the mid-1840s by positive religion, was the cornerstone of Comte’s program for social reform in post–Revolutionary France, and for the global establishment of an industrial-scientific order. Comte’s politics, like his philosophy, aimed to transcend the split between Enlightenment progressives and Counter-Enlightenment traditionalists. In addition to Bacon, Leibnitz, and Hume, he cited both Condorcet and de Maistre as major influences. Although the social sciences have long since abandoned Comte’s search for historical laws together with his wider system and project, the Durkheim tradition bears some of Comte’s imprint as do related currents in French thought like historical epistemology (Bachelard, Canguilhem) and structural Marxism (Althusser). Interest in Comte (influential in the 19th century but long considered a marginal figure) has revived in recent years among philosophers, social theorists, and students of religion, and his voluminous oeuvre has begun to be more sympathetically reassessed. The rebellious elder son of a conservative provincial tax official and a devoutly Catholic mother, Isidore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier Comte was born in Montpellier in the penultimate year of the Directory before Napoleon came to power. By his mid-teens he was a staunch atheist and republican. After winning admission in 1814 to the elite École Polytechnique in Paris to study mathematics and the physical sciences, he was expelled in 1816 together with his classmates after a conflict with school authorities. Following a year studying biology in the faculty of medicine at Montpellier, he returned to Paris, refused the loyalty oath to the restored monarchy that would have readmitted him to the École, and joined the Saint-Simonian circle. He became Saint-Simon’s secretary and principal collaborator until they acrimoniously split in 1824. Between 1826 and 1840 (interrupted by a mental breakdown in 1826–1827) Comte presented a celebrated lecture series, sixty in all, with a number of eminent scientists in attendance. Published in six volumes—the last three devoted to sociology—the Cours de philosophie positive established Comte as a major intellectual figure, winning the support of John Stuart Mill in England and Émile Littré in France. However, his subsequent Systême de politique positive (1851–1854)—with its religious frame, neo-medieval social program and prayerful dedication to Clotilde de Vaux (their tragically short-lived Platonic affair in 1844–1845 had catalyzed his religious turn)—divided his followers and dimmed his reputation. In his final years he continued his writings, including the never completed Synthèse subjective, lobbied rulers including the Czar and Ottoman Sultan for reform from above, and organized his church.

In contrast, the sociology of social problems defines social problem differently and adopts a different analytic approach. This approach—sometimes called constructionist—defines social problem in terms of a process, rather than a type of condition. It focuses on how and why people come to understand that some conditions ought to be viewed as a social problem, that is, how they socially construct social problems. Typically, the social problems process begins with claimsmakers who make claims that some condition ought to be considered a problem, that this problem should be understood in particular ways, and that it needs to be addressed. Other people respond to those claims and rework them, so that the social problem is constructed and reconstructed by the media, the general public, policymakers, the social-problems workers who implement policy, and critics that assess the policy’s effectiveness. The process is complex: some claims produce a speedy reaction, while others have difficulty finding an audience. The constructionist approach began to guide researchers in the 1970s and has generated a substantial literature that continues to develop in new directions.</p>",sociology

In the 1970s, feminists focused on sex roles, particularly the socialization of men and women into distinct masculine and feminine roles and the apparent universality of patriarchy. More recent work has critiqued the idea of two distinct genders, calling into question the notion of gender dichotomies and focusing attention on gender as a constitutive element of all social relationships. Gender has been described as a social institution that structures the organization of other institutions, such as the labor market, families, and the state, as well as the social relations of everyday life. In addition, scholars have pointed to the ways in which gender is constructed by organizations and individual interactions. Gender not only differentiates men and women into unequal groups, it also structures unequal access to goods and resources, often crosscutting and intersecting with other forms of inequality, such as class, race, and ethnicity.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0030,"<p>Sociology of the life course is a sophisticated theoretical paradigm designed to understand human lives. Four key assumptions guide life course scholars’ theoretical and empirical work: (1) lives are embedded in and shaped by historical context; (2) individuals construct their own lives through their choices and actions, yet within the constraints of historical and social circumstance; (3) lives are intertwined through social relationships; and (4) the meaning and impact of a life transition is contingent on when it occurs. Life course scholars also rely on rigorous research methods and data sources—including national censuses, sample surveys, in-depth interviews, and historical records—to document human lives. Because a key question of life course research is “how does historical time and place shape lives?” researchers often compare data obtained at different points in time, from different birth cohorts (i.e., individuals born at different points in history), and from different national and cultural contexts. Researchers also rely heavily on longitudinal data, or data obtained from the same person at multiple points in time, so they can track individual-level continuity and change. Life course research is interdisciplinary, incorporating concepts from sociology, history, psychology, demography, gerontology, child development, and—in recent years—behavioral genetics. The specific foci of life course studies range from social psychological outcomes such as stress, self-esteem, occupational values, and cognitive complexity to family roles, marital and fertility patterns, educational and occupational attainment, retirement, and deviance. Although many life course scholars typically specialize in one developmental stage, such as childhood, adolescence, midlife, or older adulthood, most also consider ways that one life course stage influences subsequent experiences. Most life course research has focused on the U.S. context, yet in recent years the collection of longitudinal data—especially in the United Kingdom and western Europe—has fostered a flourishing of life course research in Europe.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756841-0064,"<p>This article offers a review of key works in media sociology and identifies key themes in sociological research that have contributed to media studies. Given the interdisciplinary nature of media/communication analysis, establishing what falls within media sociology and drawing clear-cut distinctions between sociological and other approaches are not easy tasks. Here, media sociology is understood as research that situates communication and media research within the dynamics of social forces and links them to questions about order, conflict, identity, institutions, stratification, authority, community, and power. The origins of mass communication/media research are grounded in sociology. Not only was it sociologists who charted key themes in the field of communication/media studies, particularly in the United States in the 1920s, but foundational research was concerned with core sociological questions, such as the integrative role of the media in the transition from traditional to modern societies and the community-building dimensions of the media. Around the time of World War II, US media sociology experienced two transitions. Geographically, the center of studies moved from the University of Chicago to Columbia and Harvard Universities, and the research foci changed from news and media to public opinion and mass communication. Analytically, the focus shifted from the relation between media and modern society to questions about war propaganda and persuasion. Given the focus on the dynamics of public opinion, sociological questions about personal and media influence moved to the forefront, and interest in issues related to media and community faded. With financial support from the US government and private foundations, public opinion attracted considerable attention from media and communication researchers in the 1950s. However, as questions embedded in social psychology and behavioral research gained currency, sociological approaches, particularly those focused on structural issues, gradually lost centrality. This shift indicated the beginning of the rift between sociology and media/communication studies in the United States. Sociological theories and questions increasingly became less relevant for mass communication research. The historical trajectory of media sociology has been different in Europe, however. It has not had the focus on public opinion research and media effects that it has in the United States. Instead, it has been grounded in different theoretical paradigms and research questions. Traditionally, it has been more concerned with questions about class, power, institutions, and social differentiation.</p>",sociology

A deeper understanding of the social causes and consequences of climate change is evolving in sociology, yet some of the discipline’s subfields have not responded to climate change. Is this because climate change is perceived to be irrelevant or are scholars suppressing new beliefs that could disrupt the norms of their field? The sociology of the arts provides an illustrative case. This subfield has historically ignored environmental factors, but there is mounting pressure for correcting this oversight and rethinking the beliefs and norms of the field. This article argues that climate change is relevant to the sociology of the arts and that this subfield can become more aligned with the geo-ecological turn in sociology and the SSH. This turn is part of a wider epochal and existential transformation in public consciousness in response to broad changes in society and nature. Changing beliefs about the arts are therefore not explained by endogenous dynamics in the arts field. The article provides a meta-analysis of the geo-ecological turn in sociology and in interdisciplinary arts and cultural research where pioneering arguments have emerged. The analysis uses theory of disciplinary transformation in the sociology of science to analyze largely implicit sociological claims for a transformation of ‘normal science’ beliefs about (1) aesthetic exceptionalism, illustrated by a new conception of music as a study object, and (2) the role of the arts in economic growth. Some implications for the sociology of the arts are considered.",sociology

Sociologists, who should be the go‐to on major policy issues have been sidelined as other social scientists take up roles as policy advisors. Recent efforts aimed at encouraging public engagement have focused on disseminating research and producing more policy‐relevant knowledge. These are welcome resources, but they reflect a deep ambivalence toward policy sociology and a tendency to conflate participation in public discussions with policy impact. In contrast, this essay draws on recent findings about the power of policy experts to develop an organic policy sociology. Organic policy sociology depends on co‐designing and carrying out research with policymakers with whom we share critical and professional commitments. By working collaboratively with policymakers, sociologists can foster equity‐promoting policy, change how policymakers understand social problems, and improve how citizens experience policy on the ground. To that end, I offer six orienting strategies for developing and maintaining organic policy sociology projects, from finding the right partner to assessing the impact of our work.",sociology
10.1177/0011392198046002008,"Sociology was born not when good and evil were defined by what is useful or harmful to society, but rather when this correlation, exalted by the utilitarians, was placed in doubt because individualism seemed to have become a menace to society. This disjunction of the actor and the system led the most radical thinkers to conceive of a system without actors, dominated by determinisms and impersonal powers, and others to describe actors without a system, constructing in a normative void the forms of their interaction with actors who were strangers. Homo sociologicus, exalted by political philosophy, has disappeared. The globalization of the economy, which has entailed a weakening of the social and political controls that existed at the national level, has led in return to the development of identity politics which no longer defend a function but a being, not a project but a memory, which contradicts the evolution that has long defined modernity. We cannot establish a link between the system and the actor unless the latter is defined by the construction of his or her own liberty and not by the playing of specific social roles, and the former as a civil society in which the collective conditions of individual freedom are created. Social solidarity is the condition of cultural diversity, that is to say, the possibility for each person to combine in his or her own way their identity with participation in the techno-economic world.",sociology

Or will sociology, as Morris puts it, “continue pretending to be an aloof, objective, detached science”? Recently, Hirschman and Garbes issued a call for an economic sociology of race, wherein they contend that race and racism are not central to economic sociology and that economic sociologists don't engage with contemporary race scholarship. In this paper, I assess and build upon their call. I argue that while the article importantly calls for understanding race and racism in economic sociology, in practice, it—used here as an example of a broader pattern within economic sociology—re‐centers whiteness and men, reifies elitism, and erases marginalized scholars and their contributions. I set forth an alternative perspective. To rise to the Du Boisian challenge, scholars need to critique racialized modernity as Itzigsohn and Brown importantly argue. We must also root our sociological consciousness, citation practices, and conversations in existing, yet marginalized, research. Failure to do so means future research risks reproducing inequities in the discipline and continuing to marginalize the very people, theories, and research that an emancipatory sociology is meant to address.",sociology
10.1177/003803850203600402,"This paper clarifies and develops some of the arguments put forward by W.G. Runciman in his 1998 Sociology article ‘The Selectionist Paradigm and Its Implications for Sociology’. It intends to support his basic claim that mechanisms analogous to (but not synonymous with) natural selection are an important way of understanding both continuity and change in social systems. Nonetheless, it questions the emphasis of his discussion and extends his analysis of two substantive points. The argument proceeds in two stages. The paper begins by examining the many objections that Runciman rebuts and showing that many of them do not need rebuttal but are simply irrelevant to the selectionist paradigm. By irrelevant, I mean that the objections are logically flawed or simply do not apply to the selectionist paradigm as Runciman defines it. The purpose of this part of the paper is to sharpen the debate, so that attention can subsequently be focused on a smaller number of relevant objections that remain. The remainder of the paper attempts to open that debate by discussing the two relevant objections that appear most forceful. It attempts to show that, on closer examination, both objections are mistaken. The first objection is that human deliberation makes any analogy with random mutation in biology untenable. The paper argues that in fact selection and deliberation are complementary. Selection will continue to act on social practices to the extent that our models of the world are imperfect and our practices have unintended consequences. The second objection is that while selectionism is interesting, it may be irrelevant to sociological practice. The last part of the paper provides a more detailed analysis of an example used by Runciman, the task of explaining differing levels of male lethal violence across societies. This analysis suggests that while Runciman’s ‘discursive’ selectionist analysis (like functionalism) can generate suggestive hypotheses, appropriate techniques will be needed to transform those hypotheses into models which sociological research can ultimately test. It is argued that multi-agent computer simulation is a particularly suitable technique for representing evolutionary processes in social systems thus allowing selectionism to be put on the same sort of footing as other ‘middle range’ explanations like game theory and social network analysis.",sociology

The second point this article deals with is that Japanese sociologists are doing ‘homolingual address’ rather than ‘heterolingual address’. The article shows that reflexive endless translation is necessary for all of us, not only for Japanese sociologists but also sociologists all over the world. In this context, the article stresses the importance of Gerard Delanty’s analysis of the relationship between cultural translation and modernity.

Entrepreneurial opportunities are discovered in markets and organizations; how these opportunities are pursued results in different forms of entrepreneurship, such as independent start-ups, licensing activity, corporate ventures and spin-offs, and nonprofits. Entrepreneurship is therefore an engine of innovation and job creation that results in changing the distribution of wealth and fostering the well-being of individuals and groups in society. The field of entrepreneurship research is composed of interdisciplinary perspectives initially drawing from the social sciences. Because entrepreneurship is inexorably linked to institutional processes and organizational forms, the discipline of sociology has been and still remains central to the development of entrepreneurship research. In the early 21st century, considerable resources have been devoted to the study of entrepreneurship, and this momentum points to an increasing variety of research perspectives. Although this article takes a sociological view, it also includes selected works of authors in the sister social, management, and financial sciences that borrow sociological concepts or that more fully flesh out the relevance of the sociology of entrepreneurship.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0025,"<p>We outline four identity theories typically employed by contemporary social psychologists: personal identity, role identity, social identity, and collective identity. Personal identity (see [Personal] Identity Theory), the most elementary of the four identities, was pioneered by American sociological social psychologists (SSPs), particularly Sheldon Stryker. SSPs emphasize how demographic, social, and cultural factors affect human social interaction. Personal identity is what makes every person unique, defining them through their specific biographies (e.g., name, birthplace), unique characteristics (e.g., intelligent, athletic), role identities (e.g., daughter, employee), and particular combination of private and public experiences. Role identify (see Role Identity Theory), also pioneered by American SSPs, particularly George J. McCall and J. L. Simmons, is inspired by the language of dramaturgy. Role identity is defined as the role (or character) people play when holding specific social positions in groups. It is relational, since people interact with each other via their own role identities. Social identity (see Social Identity Theory), pioneered by European psychological social psychologists, particularly Henri Tajfel and John C. Turner, emphasizes how a person’s cognition, affect, and personality traits affect immediate person-to-person social interactions and vice versa. It is the part of an individual’s self-concept formed through the knowledge of his or her membership in meaningful social groups and organizations (e.g., Kiwanis Club, the Cleveland City Club) and categories (e.g., Native American, northerner). In short, it is through our public selves that we are able to simplify the world around us by using categorizations to infer our similarities and differences to other people. Finally, collective identity (see Collective Identity Theory), also pioneered by European psychological social psychologists, especially Alberto Melucci, is the self in action. Collective identities are especially important to social movement participants, political activists, and others banding together to fight for or against social change by working on shared goals and action plans. In short, it is a process by which a set of individuals interacts to create a shared sense of identity or group consciousness.</p>",sociology

These forms of self-criticism become ever more acute in terms of their potential effects as huge transformations in university funding regimes are brought to bear on the social sciences. But none of these critiques engages satisfactorily with what is a much more foundational and serious set of problems, namely the very nature of sociology itself as a historically-situated form of knowledge production. Sociology claims to know the world around it, but in Britain today much sociology seriously fails in this regard, because it operates with radically curtailed understandings of the long-term historical forces which made the social conditions it purports to analyse. A sophisticated understanding of the contemporary world is made possible only by an equally sophisticated understanding of very long-term historical processes, precisely the sort of vision that mainstream British sociology has lacked for at least the last two decades. This paper identifies the reasons for the development of this situation and the consequences it has for the nature of sociology’s knowledge production, for its self-understanding, for its claims to comprehend the contemporary world, and for its apparent social ‘usefulness’.

This article outlines the main features of the debate and suggests various lines of analytical development which may help to resolve a number of remaining conceptual issues. Orientalism has been defined as a discourse which produces the orient as an object of power and knowledge. The discourse has a number of major themes: it provides an explanation of oriental stagnation, offering covertly a legitimation of western supremacy and colonial power; by categorizing oriental politics as despotic, because the orient excludes individualism, it offered a critique of mass democracy; and it contrasted the rationality of the occident with the sensual irrationalism of the orient. While the critique of orientalism in the 1970s was intellectually and morally important, there are some basic problems of epistemology in this tradition which are unresolved. The anti-foundationalist epistemology of the critique of orientalism often covertly relies upon a notion of the `real' orient, but it cannot offer an alternative discourse to conventional perspectives. The article argues that cultural globalism may challenge rather than support cognitive relativism because the idea of separate and different cultural traditions cannot be maintained.

I argue that counter‐revolution was instigated during the revolutionary crisis (25 January–11 February 2011), accrued momentum during the extended transitional period (12 February 2011–30 June 2013) and achieved a decisive victory after the military coup of 3 July 2013. I interrogate the varieties of counter‐revolutionary actions in these periods: repression and propaganda, adopting a project of containment during the transitional period, then launching unlimited repression campaigns against revolutionaries, and expanding military rule. This framework helps make sense of how different forces change their positions over time, and of the contradictions and the dynamism of counter‐revolutionary actions.",sociology
10.1177/s0038038500000122,"This paper argues that notions of the future and social change have been central to the sociological enterprise since its inception. However, sociology developed with the modern project and the rise of nation-states. This is reflected in the way that sociology has consistently taken for granted the geography of the nation-state as a basic organising principle for the understanding of social formations, producing `national' sociologies. Thus, while providing a view of Britain in 2025, this paper also asks questions about the imaginary that constitutes Britain and the ways in which it will be re-visioned as part of the `global cosmopolitan society'. This re-visioning is not, however, the preserve of sociology and the paper elaborates popular imaginaries on the future of Britain. A recurring theme within visions of the future is the binary between utopias and dystopias, reframed in relation to the impact of new technologies and discussions of cyberspace. The paper examines the impact of these debates on the sociological imagination and the future of the sociological enterprise.",sociology

The hidden mourning about the passing of this ideal science gives present philosophical approaches to science and scientific method their common stamp. The alternative seems to be the retreat into a sociological relativism. The paper shows that it is possible to work out a science-theoretical paradigm which avoids the pitfalls of both philosophical absolutism and sociological relativism. It suggests that instead of discussing criteria of a fictitious absolute end-state of knowledge, one might try to discover criteria and conditions for the advance of knowledge, non-scientific and scientific. A theory of this kind has the added advantage that it can be tested by, and can serve as a guide for, empirical studies of sciences and of knowledge generally. The paper also suggests that discussions about `value-freedom' should be abandoned in favour of enquiries into the use of scientific and non-scientific values in scientific work.",sociology

This approach has the added advantage of being in closer agreement with the evidence.

Initially, scholars saw nations as based on primordial attachments that were understood to exist as “given” through birth into a particular geographic community or ethnic group. This understanding has evolved into a view of “imagined communities” in which nations are based on a sense of attachment to one another among individuals dispersed across space and time and likely never to meet each other but who share customs, language, traditions, culture, or residence within a set of borders. Because these attachments are imagined by individuals and groups of individuals, neither nations nor the identities attached to them can be understood as essentialized, stable, or static. Instead, nations today are thought to be imagined, constructed, and negotiated. Nationalism exists in these moments of imagination and construction of the nation, which take many forms. The simple expression of national identity, efforts to make political and national units congruent, or xenophobic treatment of outsiders in favor of those deemed to belong to the nation are all examples of nationalist forms. Nationalism can be official and ceremonial (as in the singing of national anthems at presidential inaugurations) or banal (as in the quotidian nationalist symbols people encounter in their everyday lives, from national flags in school buildings to postage stamps displaying national heroes). Over the last several decades—particularly since a resurgence of interest in nationhood in the 1980s and 1990s—the focus of research has been on elite perspectives—that is, how the nation is mediated and constructed through parliamentary speeches, presidential speeches, or public school textbooks and curricula. More recently there has been a movement toward the study of everyday nationhood, which is discussed in greater detail in this article.</p>",sociology

The latter is frequently understood as sociology's special object with sociology itself a distinctively modern form of explanation. The period of sociology's disciplinary formation was also the heyday of European colonialism, yet the colonial relationship did not figure in the development of sociological understandings. While the recent emergence of postcolonialism appears to have initiated a reconsideration of understandings of modernity, with the development of theories of multiple modernities, I suggest that this engagement is more an attempt at recuperating the transformative aspect of postcolonialism than engaging with its critiques.

Lukes's critique of what he calls the `one' and `two-dimensional' views of power is next reviewed, and Lukes's own `three-dimensional' view subjected to analysis and criticism. Lukes's definition of power in terms of interests is identified as a major source of difficulty, and three distinct ways of constructing a distinction between `real' interests and `subjective' interests, or preferences are identified in Lukes's work. In the fourth section of the paper I present an alternative conception, or `view' of power which, I argue, sustains the essential features of Lukes's critique of the one- and two-dimensional views, but which, by severing the definitional tie between power and interests, avoids the value dependence of Lukes's own view of power. Finally, I make explicit a view of interests which runs counter to that which, I hold, Lukes, Connolly, et al. have in common with more orthodox political scientists. I go on to indicate the place of this concept in the formation and re-formation of personal and social identities, and briefly indicate its bearing on what I earlier called the `paradox of emancipation'.",sociology

I explore these dichotomous forms through four dimensions of negative social space: non-identity; inactivity; absence; and silence.

We suggest that there are many `natures' and then proceed to develop an agenda for a sociology of such natures. This comprises four elements: a sociology of environmental knowledges; social variation in the reading of natures; a sociology of the diverse forms of environmental damage; and a more general examination of environmentalism and society. We conclude with an examination of the relations between culture and nature suggesting that changes in this relationship now demonstrates what has always been the case, namely, that nature is elaborately entangled and fundamentally bound up with the social and the cultural.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0093,"<p>Despite copious studies on the middle classes, there is no single, widely held definition of the middle class. Some scholars define the middle class in terms of the relation to the means of production, others in terms of relative incomes, and still others in terms of consumption patterns. A common working definition might include those with incomes in the middle third of the income distribution; who work as upper- or lower-level managers, professionals, or small-business owners; who graduated from a four-year college or university; and whose primary source of wealth is home ownership. The sociological study of the middle classes has a long and varied past and has been driven by both theoretical and empirical concerns. Theoretically, much attention has been given to conceptualizing the historical middle classes in relation to other social classes and also accounting for the emergence of the new middle class in the latter part of the 20th century. Neo-Weberian and neo-Marxist theories of class represent two influential perspectives on the middle class. Both perspectives emphasize the importance of market capacities in shaping life chances and how the middle classes differ from the working class and the upper class on this dimension. Neo-Marxist arguments differ primarily in their additional focus on the relationship to the means of production as a key dimension of the class structure. A third influential approach to studying class structure focuses on the role of tastes, consumption patterns, and cultural boundaries in defining class relations and identifying the middle classes. Empirically, the literature on the middle class addresses the structural forces shaping the emergence of the middle class in different national contexts and how the political, economic, and social trends of the time shape the experiences of the middle class. Since the late 20th century there has been considerable attention given to analyzing the “new middle class” and uncovering in what ways members of this class differ from other classes in terms of political orientations and activities. Other work has focused on how the changing economic landscape of the postindustrial economy has led to economic uncertainty for many members of the middle class, causing an increase in consumer debt, bankruptcies, and downward mobility. The notion of social reproduction and middle-class advantage (vis-à-vis the working class) is a theme running throughout work examining the education system and studies examining religion. Additional topics of research on the middle class include the intersectionality of gender, race, and ethnicity; the importance of geospatial dimensions of space and place; and cross-national comparative work and case studies of various subpopulations and nations.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0231,"<p>Across studies of racialized modernity, critical scholars since W. E. B. Du Bois have recognized that no analysis of racism is complete without studying the social dynamics surrounding whiteness. To be sure, studies of racism frequently center on racially subordinate groups——in terms of the discrimination they experience or, worse, as the source of racial inequalities and social problems. Scholars of whiteness, however, turn their attention to the myriad ways this fictional social construction works to reinforce white power, privilege, and wealth at the level of everyday, institutional, and global experience. Notably, though the term invokes ideas related to skin color, whiteness refers more specifically to a structural position—that is, to a racialized social identity that is positioned as superior relative to other “races” within a system of racial hierarchy. Indeed, because race is socially constructed—and not biological—whiteness can be understood as the result of social and cultural processes, rooted in a global history of European colonialism, imperialism, and transatlantic slavery, and maintained today through various institutions, ideologies, and everyday social practices. Whiteness embodies both a material reality—connected to the disproportionate economic and political power wielded by those racialized as white, as well as a symbolic reality—shaped by the cultural meanings attached to whiteness as a form of inflated value, morality, aesthetics, and civilization. White people thus derive both literal and psychological advantages from whiteness through societal norms, traditions, and institutions—conditions that mask and obscure the unjust nature of white domination. Indeed, the ideological component of white supremacy is profound: whiteness is regarded as the norm or standard in society, and yet the advantages that racial dominance accrues to white people are widely unacknowledged and ignored by white people. Du Bois perhaps cut closest to the core, describing whiteness as something that acquired an almost religious character in the modern world. As he wrote in his 1920 essay “The Souls of White Folk”: “I ask soberly: ‘But what on earth is whiteness that one should so desire it?’ Then always, somehow, some way, silently but clearly, I am given to understand that whiteness is ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen!”</p>",sociology

Since then, the phenomenon has gained widespread attention with advocacy and media campaigns, a flurry of new laws and celebrities taking on the cause of fighting modern-day slavery. The UN protocol defines trafficking as a set of actions (recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt) that if undertaken by one of a set of specified means (threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person) results in exploitation. The protocol notes that at a minimum, exploitation includes “the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.” If the victim is under eighteen, the means become irrelevant. Exploitation comes in many forms and in many industries—sex, factories, construction, fishing, domestic labor, to name a few—and involves men, women, and children alike. No country is unaffected. The subject of human trafficking is the province of many academic disciplines as it touches on a variety of areas of inquiry including migration, human rights, women’s rights, border security, prostitution, and labor rights. At the same time, it also has a strong history of being rooted in advocacy. In fact, much of the early research on human trafficking was carried out by advocacy organizations and journalists who brought much-needed attention to the issue. Scholars were relative latecomers to the game. However, over the past decade, scholarly research has exploded in volume and increased in quality as both qualitative and quantitative methods have been applied to better understand the phenomenon and its manifestations. The works contained here are a guide to the major issues in human trafficking and are intended to be accessible to students, academics, practitioners, and advocates.

The concept was coined by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu to explain educational inequality in France. His concept covers a wide variety of cultural resources, such as verbal facility, general cultural awareness, aesthetic preferences, information about the school system, and educational credentials. In later writings Bourdieu suggests that what he calls cultural capital should in fact be called “informational capital.” His point is to suggest that culture (in the broadest sense of the term) can become a power resource that socially differentiates insiders from outsiders. This inequality occurs when cultural resources become objects of struggle. The concept gained traction early in educational research, in which it has been used to explain differential achievement in schooling. As a measure of family background, the importance of cultural capital relative to income and other possible stratifying factors has become the object of considerable research and debate in the sociology of education. But the concept has been imported into many other substantive areas, such as culture, consumer tastes, family, organizations, and stratification to such an extent that today it is found across a broad range of the social sciences and now figures as an important concept in introductory sociology textbooks. And the concept has provoked criticism and debate relative to how it is measured, its effects, its distribution, and variations in different national contexts.</p>",sociology

Once a marginal area in the social sciences, social movement studies grew into a main field of study in sociology and a significant one in other proximate disciplines, such as political science, anthropology, geography, history, and psychology. This growth was accompanied by significant shifts in the ways in which social movements have been addressed. Before the 1970s, especially (but not only) in the United States, social movements were conceived of as forms of collective behavior, different from “normal” behavior because of high emotionality and, often, anomic syndromes; in Europe instead, especially the main historical social movement, the labor movement, was addressed within a Marxist perspective, with attention paid to the structural conditions for its development. Since the 1970s, both approaches were shaken by the spread of new forms of protest. First of all, in the United States, studies on the civil rights movement showed that it was neither irrational nor anomic, being instead guided by strategic behavior and strong normative systems. Social movement organizations started therefore to be seen as actors that mobilize resources in their environment for collective action. In Europe, the emergence of the student, the women’s, and the environmental movements were considered as examples of new social movements, bound to substitute for the increasingly institutionalized labor movement. Class-based approaches were therefore supplanted by an attention to emerging collective identities. Social movement studies in the 1970s and the following decade focused mainly on macro-level political opportunities for protest and organizational forms and strategies at the meso level, with only limited attention to social structures and individual commitment. Since the 1990s, this structural bias was then challenged by a renewed attention to various cultural aspects, as well as to the causal mechanisms that intervene between structure and action in a field redefined as contentious politics and covering social movements as well as revolutions, democratization, and other contentious phenomena.</p>",sociology

Taken together these influences led to a progressive process of displacement as first, the original `dynamic' connotations were discarded such that `motive' was equated with `the reason' or `the reasons' for acting, and then second, identified with `justifications' and `excuses'. The arguments advanced to support these changes of usage are then considered and shown to be in part dependent on selective interpretations, or to rest on contestable claims concerning the contexts in which actors might discuss motives and the role of actor-accounts in action.

Sex came to signify the biological or bodily component of difference, that is, male and female. Gender, on the other hand, came to signify the social or cultural component of difference, that is, masculine and feminine. This sex/gender distinction, as it is often called, was heartily embraced by many feminists of the day who sought to account for differences between the sexes as well as explain and remediate women’s second-class status in society. The establishment of gender as a distinctly “social” concept appealed to feminists because it opened up an intellectual and political space—a space beyond biological determinism—for inquiry into the causes of “male domination” and “female subordination” that were not essential, universal, or fixed. In this space, social change was possible; gender relations could be reconfigured. To that end, the sex/gender distinction became, by and large, paradigmatic in feminist thought and social science, and from it grew a burgeoning body of gender theory loosely characterized as the social construction of gender. Intersectional, post-structural, postmodern, and queer schools of thought produced new insights and advanced theory in ways that posed challenges to the viability and utility of gender as a concept as well as to the sex/gender paradigm. The ensuing debates were highly productive, ushering in a new era of social theory on the body that centered corporeality and embodiment and that sought to deconstruct binary thinking. As thinking on sex/gender evolved, the conceptual split was no longer understood as a simple separation between the biological and the social. Feminist and queer scholars problematized the distinction, reformulating it as an interlocking set of relationships: the sex/gender/sexuality system. Interdisciplinary gender scholars, including prominent feminist scientists, began theorizing the complex interrelationship between sex and gender with greater sophistication in an attempt to more firmly discredit biological determinist approaches to the study of difference based on sex, gender, or sexuality. Advancing theory, research, and praxis has not only deepened understanding about a wider variety of identities, experiences, and practices around sex, gender, and sexuality but has also won greater recognition in the early 21st century for them. This multiplicity of sexes, genders, and sexualities has brought with it unique methodological concerns in the social sciences, which represent a new frontier of research and activism in gender and sexuality studies.</p>",sociology

Bourdieu deploys his basic categories using a distinctly historicist social epistemology organized around the ideas of conjuncture, contingency, overdetermination, and radical discontinuity. The origins of Bourdieu’s historicism are traced to his teachers at the École Normale Supérieure and to the long-standing aspirations among French historians and sociologists to unify the two disciplines. The historical nature of Bourdieu’s work is also signalled by its pervasive influence on historians and the historical work of his former students and colleagues. Bourdieu allowed sociology to historicize itself to a greater extent than other French sociologists.",sociology

The advantages of applying probabilistic explanations more frequently could be: improved possibilities for cross-disciplinary work; the simplification of successful explanations; an easier way to implement uncertainty to models; new ways to utilize the classical theories of sociology; and increased freedom to choose research methods. According to the previously published literature, one of the reasons for not applying probabilistic explanations has been the strong positivist heritage in sociology. The following additional factors are considered: important classics of sociology were written before probability theories matured; and qualitative methods have provided the possibility to respond to the need for empirical research. In this way, sociologists have avoided the extensive work of re-evaluating the existing theories from a probabilistic point of view.",sociology

The analysis of this form of neurosis originated in a series of research and participatory groups on the theme of `family novels and social trajectories'.

After defining what a global sociology is, I will point out two particular directions for this sociology: supplementing the postcolonial approach with an anti-authoritarian one, and theorizing post-secular society. One cannot but acknowledge the scars of the colonial era, but postcolonial studies have been rightly used but also abused. I would identify two abuses: the over-emphasis on external factors while neglecting local ones, and the binary logic of antagonistic categories such as East/West, universalism/contextualism. Thus, I make the call to supplement the postcolonial approach with an anti-authoritarian one. There are three levels of authoritarianism: one relates to the political regime; another relates rather to neoliberalism; and the third concerns attitudes. The authoritarian attitude is closely related to the difficulty of dealing with religion in our society. Global sociology should take into account in any contemporary analysis of society the new features of our post-secular society, a sort of low-key secularism in confluence with neoliberalism. In light of these two directions, I would like to see global sociology moving forward. But what should the features of this global sociology be?

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0127,"<p>Gender operates at all levels of social life and is deeply embedded in how work is organized, rewarded, and experienced. The sociological study of gender and work emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, as women’s labor force participation rates rose and as the Women’s Movement began calling attention to gender inequality at home and on the job. The field has evolved over time; conceptual frameworks have expanded and empirical foci have shifted in response to economic and societal changes. Early research focused primarily on workers and sought to determine whether and how men and women differ in their work attitudes and behavior. Over time, researchers have paid more attention to the social relations of work. Studies here focus on how the structure and culture of the workplace shape men’s and women’s social interactions and behavior. A more recent stream of literature in the gender and work area views gender as embedded within work structures and organizations. In this view, gender is not just an attribute that people bring with them to the job, but is built into the workplace itself. The development of new conceptual frameworks has been accompanied by new issues and topics. For example, the rise of the highly feminized service sector prompted an interest in the distinctive characteristics of these jobs. As dual-earner families became the norm, researchers increased attention to the ways that gender shapes work-family relations. Other topics, such as those related to gender discrimination and inequality, have been of interest to gender and work scholars since the field’s emergence in the 1960s.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0266,"<p>Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is an approach developed in the field of science and technology studies (STS) to avoid purely social and purely technical explanations for scientific and technological developments. ANT offers the departure point of symmetrical constructivism, where there are no primordially social or technical domains, only socio-technical hybrids. As such, ANT is a crucial instigator of a wider turn away from human-centric perspectives in social research. ANT decenters humans by offering an ontological outlook where all actors, humans included, are constituted through their heterogeneous relations with other entities. According to ANT, agency is not a human privilege, but something that emerges in networks of relations between humans and nonhuman alike, thus the name actor-network theory. ANT emerged in France and the United Kingdom in the early 1980s and its influence on STS in the following decades is hard to overestimate. Early ANT brought forward relational, processual, and constructivist studies of scientific practices and technological development. Since around 1990, ANT has been taken up in a wide range of contexts, as the thematic sections below illustrate. This broadening is sometimes associated with the label post-ANT, which signifies a more explicit engagement with the entanglements of multiple practical ontologies, and ethical and political concerns in ANT research, often in conversation with feminist STS and other post-structuralist approaches in the humanities and social sciences. Today, ANT approaches are at work across many scholarly disciplines and fields, where ANT tends to play the role of a heterodox and sometimes even implicit background rather than an explicit theoretical or methodological school. In response to this, the present annotated bibliography seeks to strike a balance between guiding the reader toward classic ANT texts and including some of the trajectories of research that have followed on from ANT in more or less manifest ways. It is not uncommon to omit the label of ANT even in key ANT texts. For example, a central contributor such as Michel Callon refers to the “sociology of translation” instead of ANT. As this lack of fixed vocabulary illustrates, defining the boundaries of the ANT literature is a never-ending task that only has temporary, partial solutions. The aim of this bibliography is not to claim exhaustiveness, but to provide a solid guide for students and researchers who need starting points, either for engaging with ANT in general, or for encountering work within their specific fields of study that have engaged with ANT.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0089,"<p>The prevalence of wage labor has been a defining characteristic of modern societies. Following the Industrial Revolution, the people who sold their labor for survival in the newly emerging modern societies were usually labeled as the “working class” or the “proletariat.” Originally used by Romans to label citizens with very little or no property, the term “proletariat” was adopted by Karl Marx to categorize the working class in the newly industrialized European societies, and since then the two terms have been used interchangeably. The initial dominance of industrial work made the working class synonymous with manual work. However, as service-sector employment expanded and the number of people employed in white-collar occupations increased, the definition of “working class” also changed. Today, although there are serious debates and disagreements about the definition of “working class,” or even its very existence, many scholars define the term as comprising people who earn their living through wage labor, who do not own any assets or capital, and who do not possess workplace authority. Over the years, scholars have argued that working classes differ from the rest of the societies they belong to with their politics, culture, family structures, and the conditions they live in. However, it is also not possible to talk about a single and unified working class in any society, as working classes are divided through the lines of gender, race, and ethnicity. Today, working classes all over the world are struggling with the challenges of globalization and new technologies, although the specific challenges they face differ in developed and less developed countries.</p>",sociology

It has become a focal point in the analysis of a variety of sociological questions, as well as in broader public and policy debates. The conceptual framework of citizenship in the work of T. H. Marshall (see Marshall 1950, cited under Historical Origins and Trajectories), whether endorsed or critically appraised, constitutes the starting point for much of the scholarship on citizenship. Inspired by Marshall, the scholarship shifted away from a purely legal understanding of citizenship to include concerns about social and economic inclusion, and later to questions of belonging and participation. Predominant conceptions of citizenship denote (a) membership in a polity (the nation-state), (b) a set of rights and duties that this membership carries with it, and (c) exercise of rights and obligations, and participation in the polity by members. National citizenship, the rights and duties it entails, and the identity it professes have come under significant duress as a result of the global hegemony of political and economic liberalism, particularly since the collapse of the polarized world system. Much of the work in the sociology of citizenship has developed in response to these global challenges. While a significant number of studies occupy themselves with the changing individual and collective relationship in the welfare state and in the broader context of human rights, others focus on questions of belonging and participation in a world where nation-state boundaries can no longer be taken for granted. More recently, attention has also been given to the growing global inequalities and populist reactions.

What is commonly understood as feminist theory accompanied the feminist movement in the mid-seventies, though there are key texts from the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries that represent early feminist thought. Whereas feminist theories first began as an attempt to explain women’s oppression globally, following a grand theoretical approach akin to Marxism, the questions and emphases in the field have undergone some major shifts. Two primary shifts have been (1) from universalizing to particularizing and contextualizing women’s experiences and (2) from conceptualizing men and women as categories and focusing on the category “women” to questioning the content of that category, and moving to the exploration of gendered practices. Thus, while many theorists do focus on the question of how gender inequality manifests in institutions such as the workplace, home, armed forces, economy, or public sphere, others explore the range of practices that have come to be defined as masculine or feminine and how gender is constituted in relation to other social relations. Feminist theories can thus be used to explain how institutions operate with normative gendered assumptions and selectively reward or punish gendered practices. Many contemporary feminists look beyond the United States to focus on the effects of transnational economic, political, and cultural linkages on shaping gender.</p>",sociology

In the 21st century, scholars often focus on intersectionality, taking the effects of race/ethnicity, class, sexuality, and other factors into consideration.

It examines three areas of focus within the field. One of these areas finds connections between our exploitation of animals and other forms of domination and oppression. Consequently, this body of research provides insight into how we might challenge and overcome inequality, more generally. A second area examines animal abuse and questions entrenched assumptions about the link between cruelty to animals and violence directed toward humans. This research also reveals that animals are often victims and pawns in domestic violence. A third area uses human–animal interaction to challenge dominant sociological views of the self. By doing so, this work expands our knowledge of what it means to live in a social world. Overall, the scholarly work within the field of animals and society suggests that the inclusion of animals in sociological research can expand and clarify existing theories and concepts.",sociology

Meanwhile the discussion of these issues in other disciplines grows apace. Ecological modernizers see the environmental crisis as a stimulus to capitalist societies, providing new opportunities for growth from re-tooling. Yet, sections of the environmentalist movement envisage necessary social change as much more profound. A key to this debate is the likely costs of re-tooling. This technological and financial question is a prerequisite for understanding the social implications. If the costs of re-tooling are huge, as can be argued, some drastic social changes are quite likely.",sociology

               This chapter explores the interface between sociology and social justice by bringing into dialogue three intellectual and political projects that are reshaping the frontiers of sociological praxis at different levels. First, collaborative research methodologies, which bridge theory and action by working and thinking together with our coresearchers around jointly conceived agendas/problems. For research and knowledge to matter, they must be rooted in collective struggles for social justice. Second, global sociology, paying special attention to southern theory and the “epistemologies of the south.” Along with the struggles for the decolonization of the university, this process is redefining the field in non-Eurocentric terms, locating histories of colonialism, enslavement, appropriation, and dispossession at the center of modernity; and interrogating as well epistemic violence/injustice in relation to the constitution of sociology as a discipline. Finally, decolonial struggles taking place outside the university, led by Indigenous and Black peoples and communities. These struggles usually understand the concept and praxis of decolonization in ways that exceed the “social justice framework.” Thus, they allow us to free ourselves from a modern/Eurocentric horizon of liberation, and to transform our sociological and political imagination accordingly.",sociology

Philosophy's absolute truth claims assume a shared life experience of all free persons but functionalist modern society confines the production of meaningful world-views to a limited number of intellectuals. They can only discover the experience of others by reifying them through science. None of the empirical research strategies of the sociologist can provide a perfect solution to this dilemma, while theoretical sociology has to operate through generalised concepts of structure and action Marx too had to operate through the fetishistic category of class, and concepts such as state, market and economy are all fetishistic But rational action is by definition non-fetishistic, and its interpretation is the primordial task of philosophy.

Drawing on British examples, we argue that whereas over the past 40 years sociologists championed innovative methodological resources, notably the sample survey and the in-depth interviews, which reasonably allowed them to claim distinctive expertise to access the `social' in powerful ways, such claims are now much less secure. We argue that both the sample survey and the in-depth interview are increasingly dated research methods, which are unlikely to provide a robust base for the jurisdiction of empirical sociologists in coming decades. We conclude by speculating how sociology might respond to this coming crisis through taking up new interests in the `politics of method'.",sociology

Though foundational accounts of citizenship situate the sources and boundaries of civil rights, by far the most frequent usage of the term is in relation to the US civil rights movement, which has served as the central case informing prevailing theories of social movements. The movement’s canonical status and sweeping impacts on political, economic, and social life has given rise to a loosely bounded conception of an associated era, with much scholarship focusing on the contours of racial discrimination and mobility in the “post-civil rights” decades that have followed. Another area of movement influence relates to the encoding of civil rights protections in legislation and court decisions. A particularly robust literature has engaged with the implementation and enforcement of various provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as its impact on subsequent related legislation, such as the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act. The legacy of the movement is also evident in its influence on subsequent civil rights movements, both tactically and through their ability to advance “civil rights” claims in familiar and resonant ways. The unique and familiar character of the civil rights movement, then, has ensured that conceptions of civil rights remain prevalent within a variety of sociological literatures––from social movements, to organizations, gender, race and ethnicity, and the sociology of law––while perhaps paradoxically discouraging focused research on the definitional and political contours of the term itself.</p>",sociology

However, social gerontologists do study how biological processes influence the social conditions of aging. Societal aging is one of the most important social trends of this century. It affects the major political, social, and economic institutions as well as the nature of interpersonal and familial relationships. Key issues concern how population aging influences retirement patterns, income security, health care, and politics, and how these trends, in turn, affect the policy options available. Social gerontologists recognize, however, that old age is just one life stage and that the quality of later life is determined by events, opportunities, and decisions made earlier in life. Thus, many studies in this field adopt a framework that emphasizes the life course as a way to make sense of long-term trends and to explain differences among groups on the basis of race, gender, class, and ethnic origin. The life course perspective also provides a roadmap for thinking about how health, social relationships, and socioeconomic status change over time and across life stages.</p>",sociology
10.1177/1468795x03003001695,"I offer a discussion of Simmel’s Philosophy of Money in comparison with the analyses of money in the writings of Marx, Weber and Durkheim. Based on this analysis, I argue that Simmel’s ambiguous status as a classic can be accounted for by some of the characteristics of his approach as well as the historical (non-)reception of his work. Simmel’s relative neglect in sociology for the better part of the century as well as his recent revival with the rise of the new cultural studies and the postmodern paradigm shift hint at an important interdependence between the history and systematics of sociological theory. The theme of money has not managed to be accepted as an undisputed topic of sociological reflection because of its non-independent status in most social theories (apart from Simmel’s) as well as the factual resistance to totalizing accounts (like Simmel’s) in the history of sociology. Recent transformations in social theory, however, indicate that money may, and to some extent already has, become a more autonomous topic of inquiry. In conclusion, I argue that Simmel’s work does lend itself to be taken up in postmodern perspectives and that the sociological study of money can likewise be appropriated by the new cultural studies. However, these new perspectives will have to come to terms with the modernist resistance of Simmel and the other sociological classics’ remaining influence in contemporary sociological theory.",sociology

He attended high school in Winnipeg and entered the University of Manitoba in 1939, majoring in natural sciences. However, his interests shifted toward the social sciences before he left in 1942, still some credits short of his degree. He returned to study at Toronto in 1944, obtaining a BA degree in 1945. That fall he began studies toward the MA degree in sociology at the University of Chicago. Initially influenced by W. Lloyd Warner, his 1949 master’s thesis gave an ethnographic analysis of the responses of cosmopolitan middle-class women as they refused to take entirely seriously the demands of the Thematic Apperception Test that Goffman administered. His doctoral dissertation, “Communication Conduct in an Island Community” (1953), was based on fieldwork in the Shetland Islands sponsored by the University of Edinburgh’s Social Anthropology department. In it Goffman first introduced the term “interaction order” to describe the domain of social life established by co-present persons. This was the sociological terrain he made his own. The investigation of the properties of the interaction order provided the thread that ran through the disparate topic-matters of his eleven books and more than a dozen significant journal articles. Goffman stayed another year in Chicago following the successful defense of his dissertation, drafting an original monograph (The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, first published in 1956 in Edinburgh) and papers on face-work, embarrassment, involvement, and deference and demeanor. Between the end of 1954 and 1957 he worked as a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health, conducting the fieldwork and writing that led to Asylums (1961). Appointed to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1958, he rose quickly to full professor in 1962. A sabbatical year at Harvard prefigured a move to the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, where he remained until his untimely death in 1982.</p>",sociology

It requires us to understand that public sociology is only possible at the intersection of two distinct fields – the academic field and the political field. Public sociology proves to be a rather precarious pursuit, then; first, because of competing demands internal to the academic field; second, because of the difficulty in operating at the intersection of the academic and political fields; and third, because of the obduracy of common sense that cannot be easily dislodged, the very attempt often arousing open hostility.

On one hand, when going social, semiotics seems more interested in analyses of social artifacts or texts than social life processes in their sociality and not just textuality. On the other, when going semiotic, sociology tends to appropriate formal understandings of structure, only to realize that structuralist efforts are impractical for complex explanations of social life. To overcome these challenges, the chapter proposes integrating two main traditions of meaning-making from the outset: Saussure’s and Peirce’s semiotics. Thus, to lay solid foundation to sociocultural explanation we need a sophisticated theory of signification in social life. A theory where signs—vehicles of meaning—signify via self-referential differentials but also via reflexive indexicalities that anchor them at multiple social levels. Expanding on these themes, the chapter turns to three open problems at the crossroads of semiotics and sociology, namely indexicality and context-making, habituation and power, and culture and cognition. Finally, the contributions are outlined. From different perspectives, each contribution attempts to provide elements to answer: Is there a space for semiotics in an agenda that pushes interpretive sociology forward?</p>",sociology

This not-so-tacit arrogance only further privileges the university as the primary site of knowledge production, while rendering invisible the many knowledge producers outside the academy. As public sociology continues to curry favor with mainstream media, politics, and policy institutes, it reveals a steadfast faith in the state and capital, while obscuring radical alternatives. In turn, public sociology functions as a counterinsurgency tool via professionalization. Conversely, a counter-public sociology refuses to comply with oppressive state protocols.

Less work has gone into developing analytic categories that allow us to capture the complex imbrications of technology and society. This article addresses two particular aspects of this challenge through two organizing efforts. First, understanding the place of these new technologies from a sociological perspective requires avoiding a purely technological interpretation and recognizing the embeddedness and the variable outcomes of these technologies for different social orders. These technologies can indeed be constitutive of new social dynamics, but they can also be derivative or merely reproduce older conditions. Second, such an effort will, in turn, call for categories that capture what are now often conceived of as contradictory, or mutually exclusive, attributes. The article examines these two aspects by focusing on three analytic issues for sociology: the embeddedness of the new technologies, the complex interactions between the digital and the material world, and the mediating cultures that organize the relation between these technologies and users.",sociology

10.1177/0268580908101063,"This essay is a critical analysis of Da Silva's G. H. Mead: A Critical Introduction, which has the twofold goal of introducing Mead's thought to a new generation of scholars and inspiring a scholarly debate concerning the significance of his work in modern social science. The discussion acknowledges the originality of Da Silva's conception of Mead's thought as a system that develops in and through a dialogue with other thinkers. Nevertheless, this dialogue is shown to be inadequate as a strategy for reconstructing Mead's social psychology, which did not rely solely upon philosophy and psychology. The focus is brought to bear on Da Silva's uncritical acceptance of authoritative opinion concerning the main sources of Mead's inspiration, among which not even a single sociologist is mentioned. The essay argues, on the one hand, that Blumer's symbolic interactionism compressed two quite different traditions into one — a view adequately supported by evidence. Meadian scholarship then continued to conflate and subsume under `Mead' what may be termed the micro-sociopsychological tradition, as found in the pioneering works of Cooley, and what may be termed the macro-sociopsychological tradition of Mead himself, to which the former gave impetus. The essay also maintains that the origin of Mead's theory cannot be properly understood outside its indebtedness to the sociological climate in America at the turn of the 20th century, which was conditioned by the social and psychological ideas of such thinkers as Jane Addams and Freud. The conclusion is drawn that if the relationship between symbolic interactionism and modern social theory is to be understood, then the area of research should be extended from the main canonical gallery, in which Mead deservedly has a place, to what may be described as the `minor sociological gallery' of Simmel, Tarde, Addams and Cooley, which at present remains in the background.",sociology

To flesh out this thesis, the paper examines the place of Erving Goffman in Chicago sociology and the ingenious way he blended various strands comprising this tradition. The discussion starts with the debate on what constitutes the Chicago school, after which it moves to the knotty relationship between Goffman and symbolic interactionism and his determined effort to accommodate structuralist premises within process-oriented sociology. An argument is made that Goffman followed the lead of his mentor, Everett Hughes, in casting social institutions as “going concerns” that run the gamut from large scale formal organizations to taken-for-granted collective enterprises which are honored in the breach. Several empirical studies developing Goffman’s theory of total institutions are reviewed to flesh out his brand of structural interactionism. The paper concludes with reflections on the retroactive nature of reconstructing a school’s origins, problematic practice of assigning sociologists to a specific paradigm, and the affinity of Goffman’s sociology with the classical inquiry into a dialectical relationship between agency and structure.

Correspondingly, people's relationships to things and to other people seem to fall in two broad categories, often regarded as mutually exclusive: either as impersonal, economic or market relationships with strangers, or as personal gift relationships with intimates, friends or relatives. The `social life of things', however, is more varied. Drawing on Alan Page Fiske's theory of the four fundamental models of human relationship, four ways in which people may relate to each other and to things are distinguished; these models are applied to empirical data from a study on the giving of gifts in the Netherlands. Complications may occur when the parties to the transaction do not share the same frame of mind with respect to each other and to the things that are being transferred. Things may have conflicting social lives.",sociology

In countries such as the UK, the funding of research in social science and other subjects has become increasingly dependent on the perception that research will contribute towards the achievement of certain national goals. Despite renewed discussions surrounding the utility of social analysis, these are rarely informed by debates in academic communities about the meaning of `relevance' or associated debates about the status of knowledge. However divergent policy and academic discussions about relevance may appear, they intersect in concerns over the identity of researchers, the practices of research, and the claims made on behalf of research.

These experiments engage with Pierre Bourdieu as a Buddhist quantum physicist, Emile Durkheim as a New Age transpersonal psychologist, and Michel Foucault as a daemon-inspired revolutionary. The three experiments illustrate that, while many worlds (consisting of objective and subjective structures) exist, they tend to collapse into a few through “echo effects” produced by the powerful; these powerful echo effects are counteracted by the evolution of Spirit or Collective Consciousness growing more enlightened; and the more individuals reconnect with Spirit, the more echo effects are transformed into resonances, pointing to the pluriversal future that permits many worlds to co-flourish. This spiritual–sociological experimentation not only articulates an immanent–transcendent critique of modernity (or any society), but also suggests that contemplative practice be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate education because the quality of sociological research depends fundamentally on that of the researcher's mind.",sociology

To achieve it, the article provides a review of sociological theories of culture. In particular, the theories of P.A. Sorokin, T. Parsons and M.S. Archer are considered. The article demonstrates the specifics of the culture of digital society. The historical stages of development of this phenomenon are highlighted. A trend towards digitalisation of public life is identified. Next, the concept of culture of digital society is discussed directly. The final part of the article emphasises the connections between the culture of digital society and general sociological theories of culture. Finally, new research questions regarding further study and conceptualisation of the culture of digital society are posed. In conclusion, the author accentuates the necessity to conduct empirical research on specific and general cases related to the studied concept.",sociology

I illustrate how men's diverse institutional roles surrounding medicalized experiences of infertility are critical for understanding inequality in reproduction. Situating research on men and infertility in the theoretical framework of gender as social structure shows how men's secondary position in reproduction can be seen across institutional roles, which include men as patients, men as partners, men as sperm donors, and men as doctors. Men's experiences with reproductive medicine often reinforce men's marginal position in reproductive medicine through institutionalized arrangements; yet, men are intimately and structurally involved in reproductive decisions. I argue that bringing gender to the center of research on infertility could make clear the many structural ways women and women's bodies are controlled, regulated, and treated by reproductive medicine.",sociology

It is marked by the emphasis on social processes, human agency and the dimension of time. These aspects of social reality become central foci of 'new historism' or 'historical sociology'. With the ascendance of this new trend the relationship of sociology and history enters a third phase: after initial hostility and mutual stereotyping through attempts at external integration, it reaches a phase of immanent integration. From ahistorism typical of early nineteenth century European sociology, as well as early American sociology, our discipline moves gradually toward the recognition of the historical coeflicient of social phenomena, and accordingly the necessity of historical perspective in social studies. Historical orientation is recon structed as a set of six ontological and six methodological assumptions, and it is suggested as a fruitful approach not only to traditional macro-structural problems, but also to the domain of micro-structures and micro-processes.",sociology

Sociologists with even fleeting awareness of the recent history of political sociology are surely familiar with the cultural turn, the global turn, and the turn toward complexity; however, another turn seems to be afoot, one toward existential concerns that direct us to recover how people experience ‘the complex contradictions of the social and political world’ (Taylor, The New Political Sociology, p. 197). Complex experiences often leave behind residues or ‘traces,’ and contributors in a recently edited volume challenge sociologists to unlock the social significance of these traces and find new ways to capture what our methods capture so poorly, namely, popular forgettings, geographies of exclusion, and the slow erasure of deeds, memories, and other subjugated knowledges belonging to individuals who find themselves dismissed, dispelled, or disenfranchised by nation-states. Traces left behind by individuals navigating the complexities of contemporary experiments in human ‘being’ are just the sort of analysis that must, in principle, place the actor at the center of analysis, and, after careful study, we now appreciate that despite the analytical ease of assuming that actors are singular, sociologists should examine actors as plural and unearth their essential multiplicity.",sociology

Researchers appear to be obsessed with what are mistakenly seen as cosmopolitan issues.  The author identifies a number of different perspectives from which one can explore the possible future of the sociology of work: the organization of the profession, its academic-scientific structure, and trends in work and in social demand for the discipline.  The author argues that to ensure a positive future for both the sociology of work and the societies in which it is practised, sociology must regain its role in the definition of sociological problems and so prevent the conscious ideological trivialization of the discipline. He also argues the case for continual theoretical reconstruction and epistemological vigilance so that sociology can define its theoretical field and identify possible paths towards a greater social role for the discipline.",sociology

No longer a stepchild of the serious business of sociologists, the arts are, if not central, then at least a legitimate, as opposed to a frivolous subject. This flowering has come about despite a traditional anti-aesthetic orientation in American social science, and, until recently, relative retarded development of much contemporary European social science. Still, the position of the arts in the social science disciplines is likely to remain tenuous, and requires renewed justification as an intellectual enterprise. The reasons for this have to do both with the intellectual outlooks that have become embedded in understandings of the arts, and the social structures of their creation – or ‘production.’ The most promising developments in sociology are fostered by recognition of many more genres of creativity and their incorporation in the aesthetic domain. This growth is related to socioeconomic and political trends, consumerism, industrial transformation of global scope, though is not reducible to them.

Environmental sociology has been described as comprising four major areas of research. First, environmental sociologists study the social causes of environmental problems. Along these lines, scholars have developed an array of theoretical frameworks to explain how various social factors, including demographic, social, cultural, political, economic, and technological dynamics, generate environmental impacts and problems, and they have conducted many empirical studies on a wide range of environmental indicators to assess hypotheses derived from these theories. Second, environmental sociology is concerned with how the natural environment influences and impacts society. Early environmental sociologists strongly emphasized the dependence of human societies on the natural environment and stressed that the field should consider how the environment shapes society in addition to how society impacts the environment. Research in this area tackles issues such as the social consequences of natural disasters and the inequitable distribution of environmental hazards along racial and socioeconomic lines. Third, environmental sociology examines social reactions and responses to environmental threats and problems. Research in this area focuses on understanding patterns and trends in environmental attitudes and behaviors (e.g., recycling) as well as various aspects of the environmental movement. Fourth, environmental sociologists are concerned with understanding social processes and dynamics that could advance environmental reform and sustainability. In general, environmental sociology has tended to focus more on explaining how society causes environmental problems while paying less attention to potential solutions, but a shift has taken place in recent decades. The development, discussion, and empirical assessment of theories of environmental reform, analyses of potential solutions to environmental crises, and drafting of conceptual frameworks for sustainability have become important foci of scholarly activity in environmental sociology. Another major area of research, one that cuts across the preceding four, is the human dimensions of global climate change, which has become one of the main substantive issues studied by environmental sociologists. In this article, important scholarly works in each of these five areas are highlighted and briefly discussed, along with a selection of the most relevant textbooks, handbooks and collections, encyclopedia and review articles that provide general overviews of the field, and academic journals that publish environmental sociology research.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0203,"<p>Beginning with many of its earliest writings, sociology has a long tradition of theorizing the role of objects and material culture in social life. In the middle of the 20th century, these themes were taken up again by major sociological and anthropological thinkers who inspired a resurgence of interest in the study of objects. The sociology of culture and art began to address the production and reception of objects, while scholars from anthropology, cultural studies, and media studies began to develop a robust body of work around material culture. These two fields have somewhat different takes on the study of objects. Sociological accounts tend to be people focused, examining how institutional characteristics of art worlds shape the objects produced, and focusing explanations of meaning-making on the social position of the audience more so than the symbolic qualities of the object. Alternatively, material culture approaches tend to be object focused, engaging objects as symbols that help explain how people organize subcultures, create solidarity through exchange, or express social status. A turn toward materiality, originating from anthropology but taken up more recently in sociology, privileges the material qualities of objects and how they shape the use and symbolic meaning of objects. This work on objects raises the question of how sociologists should incorporate objects into accounts of action. This question has sparked an ongoing cross-disciplinary debate about whether objects have agency. Research in science and technology studies, alongside studies of craft and sport, have brought attention to how objects act back, shaping how knowledge is produced. Objects have also been understood as mechanisms of power, by shaping categories and morality, ritualizing icons, stabilizing social relations as instruments of the states and institutions, and structuring action through the built environment. These robust and vibrant areas of research make a strong case for the incorporation of objects into theories of power and knowledge.</p>",sociology

Schmitt targeted sociology by way of a criticism not of Durkheim but of Léon Duguit, who had been inspired by Durkheim and pleaded for a collaboration between legal scholars and social scientists.

The source of this constant revision yet limited range lies in the tension between the empirical aspiration to describe the social world and the complex issues raised by attempts to do so, the difficulty of which is often seen as frustrating to students.",sociology

However, whilst the claims made for its benefits, or limitations, are diverse in character and provenance, it is possible to identify one significant source as being related to modes of academic governance. This relation has significant effects, but is also obscured by the heterogeneity of wider claims. A critical analysis of the relation is therefore needed in order to assess its significance for sociology: however, the mode of governance in question itself poses challenges to the idea or project of sociological critique. This article therefore attempts firstly to clarify the specificity of interdisciplinarity as a feature of academic governance, and secondly, drawing on Boltanski’s recent reformulation of sociological critique, to begin a critical analysis of its significance for sociology within this particular governmental context.",sociology

Theories and methods used by sociologists of death, dying and bereavement are briefly outlined, followed by a number of key debates and challenges: denial, taboo and sequestration; death and the media; how to integrate scholarship in collective memory and Holocaust studies; theorising contemporary rites of passage; the lack of comparative research; and the need to focus on the meaning and organisation of death for those who encounter it most directly; namely, the poor, displaced and elderly. A brief discussion of undergraduate and postgraduate teaching is followed by the conclusion that any promise of a general sociology conducted in the light of mortality has been eclipsed by yet another specialism, the sociology of death.",sociology

Thinking is typically seen as something intensely private and fleeting in nature, two qualities that make it resistant to sociology’s efforts to get a grip on it. Earlier attempts to make a sociological analysis of thinking are surveyed, from Durkheim over the sociology of knowledge to today’s sociology of ideas and other approaches. An argument is made that a sociology of thinking could get some important inspiration from philosophy, especially when it comes to topics to analyze and the setting of an agenda. To exemplify this argument, some writings on thinking by Kant, Kierkegaard, and Heidegger are presented. The paper ends with some reflections on the normative dimension of thinking and a sociology of thinking.",sociology

In order to do so, we demonstrate how connections between different ‘sensory worlds’ involve equivocal understandings about what the ‘social’ entails. We begin by considering current anthropological reflections on the equivocal character of social relations as well as the equivocal ways in which western sociology has conceptualized the ‘social’. In order to visualize how ‘equivocal connections’ between different sensory worlds emerge, we build on Mapuche indigenous understandings about how different practices open up different sensory worlds. Through the examination of one of the hunger strikes that has taken place in the conflict between Mapuche people and the Chilean state, we show how such equivocal connections entail ontological, rather than epistemological, differences. Both as ethical and epistemological imperative, these differences must be actively demonstrated in order to reinvigorate the sociological imagination.",sociology
10.1177/0011392120907639,"Academic disciplines are defined not primarily by their object but by their (theoretical and methodological) approach to that object, and by their claim to a monopoly over it. Even where that monopoly claim has been highly successful, it remains contestable. For example, economics, perhaps in this respect the most successful social science, finds its object – the economy – contested by political economists and economic sociologists. Whereas economics has successfully marginalized potential competitors, sociology has remained a broad church. Attempts to impose theoretical and methodological order on the discipline have met with resistance, and eventually failed. Moreover, sociology has never really reached consensus on what its object is; ‘society’, ‘social facts’, ‘social action’ were the classical options, with the list growing over time (social networks, rational action, actor networks, etc.). Thus, while we can speak of ‘heterodox economics’ there is insufficient orthodoxy to speak of ‘heterodox sociology’. This has an obverse side. Precisely because of the weakness of its monopolistic claims, sociology has been very productive in spawning new disciplinary fields, which, rather than remaining within sociology’s weak gravitational pull, successfully establish themselves as separate disciplines or ‘studies’. Criminology, industrial relations, urban studies and organization studies are the most obvious examples. In light of this, this article addresses two questions: (1) What happens to these new fields when they break free of the parent discipline, and to the parent discipline when they do? (2) If one effect on the ‘offspring’ is a loss of disciplinary orientation (as the rationale for this special issue suggests) what, if anything, has contemporary sociology to offer OS as a potential source of reorientation?",sociology

While artists, support personnel, manufacturers, and patrons continue to anchor the field, because of culture’s entrée into the economic arena there has been an influx of diverse actors and institutions with various stakes and logics. These new actors with a vested interest in the field include local elected officials, small-business owners, and the creative class, as well as national nonprofits, state agencies, and commercial institutions. With the emergence of creativity as an economic growth strategy, there has been a great deal of analysis on the cultural economy in a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to sociology, economics, public policy, city and regional planning, and urban studies.

Despite their significant role in the processes of neighborhood communication and the construction of local communities, this phenomenon has been little comprehended by social science. The purpose of this article is to offer variants of adaptation of some sociological approaches to the analysis of the phenomenon of neighborhood chats. The nature of neighborhood chat as an institutional and communication-oriented tool for information exchange is described. The classification of neighborhood chats according to the level of their closeness is given. The forms of control in the selection of participants in closed versions of neighborhood chats are explained. The communicative side of neighborhood chat is proposed to be considered through the prism of E. Goffman’s “dramaturgy”. Conceptualizations of the basic concepts of “dramaturgy” in the context of digital neighborhood interaction are proposed. The complicated nature of neighborhood chat as a technological and social phenomenon is analyzed using the actor-network theory approach. The identification of neighborhood chat as an “actor-network” has been substantiated. The functional side of neighborhood chat as a mechanism of assemblage of neighborhood communities is considered in correlation with R. Oldenburg’s concept of the “third place”. It is shown that the neighborhood chat, being rather a digital simulation of the “third place”, can potentially compensate for the lack of real public spaces in the conditions of typical development, launching and supporting the processes of integration on the locality.",sociology

The main methodological foundations of application of Bayesian approach in statistics are briefly reviewed: the use of priors in analysis, features of Bayesian statistical inference, differences in frequency and Bayesian confidence intervals, features of hypothesis testing in Bayesian statistics. A Bayesian model of a comparative binomial experiment has been constructed. It supports comparison of independent and dependent samples of binomial variables, and also allows for differences in sizes of the compared samples. The capabilities of the model, as well as the principles of the Bayesian hypothesis testing, were demonstrated on test data using PyMC and ArviZ, contemporary free packages of the Bayesian modeling and analysis. The use of these tools allows implementing direct tensor operations with the obtained posterior distributions and provides the researcher with an effective way to calculate the effect size when comparing two binomial samples without having to resort to complicated forms of calculating this parameter. The possibilities and limitations of the Bayesian approach are shown in the context of comparative analysis of the results of binomial experiments in social sciences by estimating the probability of hypotheses via finding and comparing the area of intervals of posterior distributions",sociology

This paper draws on recent work on the gendering of organisation and bureaucracy to suggest that a key issue for consideration is not so much the exclusion of women from work defined as professional, but rather their routine inclusion in ill-defined support roles. This adjunct work of women, it is argued, facilitates the `fleeting encounter' of professional practice, thereby resting on, and celebrating, a specific historical and cultural construction of masculinity and a masculinist vision of professional work. In an era where professions are under unprecedented public scrutiny, sociological attention to their renewal needs to recognise that a key feature of profession, as presently defined, is that it professes gender.",sociology

I argue, however, that positive freedom as it was theorised by the classical sociologists must be distinguished from the more fashionable idea of individual self-realisation and self-identity, a notion equally susceptible to idealist constructions, and one increasingly targeted by Foucault-inspired critics. Instead I draw on Hannah Arendt and André Gorz to show how positive freedom should be theorised as a worldly, conflictual, and pre-eminently political affair.",sociology

Marx's critique of the ahistorical errors and alternative emphasis on the historical character of social system constitute the theoretical unifying theme of his social studies.

Building on sociological, psychological, and queer theoretical approaches, I propose four such dimensions: affect, knowledge, mutual action, and norms. The degree of overlap between these four dimensions suggests a continuum between “strong” and “weak” intimacies.

What would a developed sociology of the moral constitution of society look like? It would firstly have to be empirical and not philosophical; secondly it would have to produce an `irritant' and thus a communicative learning process within sociology itself. The necessary condition for this is the interdiction of self-exemption. The proposed correlation between this negative condition and moral communication is refutable only if moral communication could be found signalling esteem and disesteem in which the communicator took the licence of not applying the proclaimed standards reflexively. The division of labour cannot, in itself, be the source of morality because it is ruled by self-exemption. In moral communication, the duality of ego and alter and the opposition of esteem and disesteem are translated into a binary code that opposes positive and negative values and which is acceptable to both sides of a moral dispute as a framework to which they can refer. Codes are invariant but specific; ethical programmes change historically with the structural changes of the social system. This is not to end with a sterile relativism but to make the distinction, pace Durkheim, between ethics and the sociology of moral communication.",sociology

The study of forced migration is linked to research on economic migration, but has its own specific research topics, methodological problems and conceptual issues.

To investigate images from a sociological perspective, the article argues, implies to analyse the visual logic that shapes, and is constituted by, social practices.

Both share a common intellectual legacy in the differentiation of the social sciences. The economic and sociological work of Joseph Schumpeter provides an outstanding point of cross-disciplinary transgression and reintegration. In this context, this article claims that it is a curious fact that the role of technological and organizational innovation as a driving force of capitalist evolution characterized by disruptive change has become the paradigmatic foundation of related debates in evolutionary economics, but not in economic sociology. Of course, in economic sociology, technological change has been repeatedly covered regarding the social structures and network relations underpinning technological change in various settings of organizations, industries, markets and spaces. Yet the phenomenon of the introduction of novelty as such, drawing on constellations of power and domination in the context of radical uncertainty, enforcing the disruption and reconfiguration of social relations has remained rather underrepresented in the major strands of sociological reasoning on economic affairs. This assessment holds especially for neo-institutionalist reasoning, which emphasizes the drive towards stability in industries and markets, and therefore underestimates the actual characteristic of capitalism an innovation-driven system of persistently radical changes. Elaborating on this concern, this article outlines the basic relationship between evolutionary economics and economic sociology as point of departure for presenting the evolutionary approach to innovation as a promising concept for future reasoning in economic sociology. In conclusion, this implies that bringing innovation back into economic sociology implies a revitalization of Schumpeterian positions while entering a transdisciplinary dialogue with current advances in evolutionary economics and related fields of innovation studies.",sociology

By developing a sustained engagement with Boaventura de Sousa Santos’s work, as well as establishing possible connections with what has been termed the ‘turn to ontology’ in anthropology, in this article I argue that in order for sociology to become exposed to the deeply transformative potential of non-Eurocentric thinking, it needs to cultivate a decolonial imagination that may enable it to move beyond epistemology, and to recognise that there is no social and cognitive justice without existential justice, no politics of knowledge without a politics of reality.",sociology

It examines how ‘the new mobilities paradigm’ differs from earlier approaches to globalization, nomadism, and flow, and outlines some of the key themes and research areas within the field, in particular the concepts of mobility systems, mobility capital, mobility justice, and movement-space. In addressing new developments in mobile methodologies and realist ontologies, this review of the field concludes with a call for an emergent vital sociology that is attentive to its own autopoiesis.",sociology

As a result, sociology needs to incorporate the analysis of affective structures and emotional dynamics into its objects of study. The integration of feelings, affects, moods and emotional states into sociological research, which began four decades ago with the birth of the sociology of emotions, must continue advancing until emotions are fully integrated into the general sociological perspective. This article offers an introductory and critical overview of the work sociologists of emotions have carried out so far. They have helped us, first of all, to understand what an emotion is, the countless number of existing feelings, and the great complexity of emotional processes. Second, they have revealed the social nature of human emotions, and the emotional nature of social phenomena. Third, they have developed a number of theoretical approaches to studying the emotions. And, lastly, they have carried out sociological analyses of many specific emotions (fear, trust, shame, etc.), and emotional analyses in many areas of sociology (gender, work, organizations, social movements, etc.). This article also offers suggestions for the future development of the sociology of emotions, and a selected and updated bibliography.",sociology

In his study The City Weber practices a true historical sociology in contradistinction to the formal theoretical sociology developed in his Economy and Society. In The City Weber develops implicit sociological paradigms of the group, power, and the relation between economics and politics that are nowhere to be found in his formal theoretical sociology, and that indeed, in some instances, contradict the latter.  In The City Weber also utilizes an historical paradigm that resolves the tension between History and Sociology by way of a dialectic in which the sociological paradigm becomes a pure heuristic which is negated at the moment when the historical sociologist returns to the contemplation of the concrete historical reality.",sociology

In discussing the social origins of GEC, I identify four distinct forces of GEC, each of them amplified by the process of globalization.

Enthralled by the potential of research films and having made three films so far, the author believes that this medium offers great opportunities for sociologists. As a powerful means of communication with its tremendous appeal to sociologists and the public alike, research films have a future as an effective tool of data collection like surveys and interviews. But this largely depends upon the readiness of sociologists to make use of the medium of film in their research, by sparing some of their time to learn the necessary skills of filming and editing. Making research films is as rigorous as writing a research paper or a book, and it offers a great deal of satisfaction and pleasure to the sociologist-filmmaker. Against a backdrop of the production of the author's own research films, this article looks at the relevance of the medium to present sociological concepts and theses, the work associated with the production of a research film, the skills that can be learned to produce a movie without relying on film professionals, and the impact that it can have on the career of sociologists in the near future.",sociology

Even their eagerness to introduce Western theories of sociology was an integral part of this effort to elucidate Japan’s ‘uniqueness’. The fact that Japan was not colonized and managed to develop an extensive domestic education/labor/language/publishing market played an important role in this predominantly domestic focus of Japanese sociology.

10.1093/obo/9780190922481-0016,"<p>Urban sociology is among the earliest and richest areas of sociological inquiry. It touches on topics and problems related to the way urban areas develop and the way people live in urban areas. While most of the attention of urban sociologists has been on more contemporary urban settings in Western societies, they’ve shown increasing interest in urban development and urban life in so-called developing countries and the Far East, especially India and China. By nature an interdisciplinary pursuit, five major academic fields contribute to urban sociology: anthropology, economics, history, political science, and social psychology. Specialists in these respective disciplines read and cite each other’s work and borrow from each other’s theoretical insights. One major profession, urban planning, is affiliated with urban sociology. It, too, has its own entry in Oxford Bibliographies in Geography: “Urban Planning and Geography.” Other Oxford Bibliographies touch on themes discussed here. Among them are “The Chicago School of Urban Sociology,” “Suburbanism,” “Gentrification,” “Residential Segregation,” “Community,” “Urban Economics,” “Social Movements in Cities,” and “Riots.” Given the rich disciplinary sources that feed into urban sociology, this area of inquiry probably can be best understood by the themes that allow researchers to connect the disparate kinds of studies they do. The several sections into which this essay is divided have works that reflect one or more of the following four themes: (1) Urban sociologists focus on either the physical development of urban places (i.e., urbanization) or the way of life or culture practiced there (i.e., urbanism). (2) The work of urban sociologists asks how urban places are built and laid out as cities and metropolitan areas. It also asks how urban settlements might be rebuilt or developed so they better serve or complement the way people live there. (3) Some sociologists look at smaller groups of urban dwellers or venues in urban areas such as neighborhoods (i.e., “micro” studies) and other kinds of “communities” such as those one might find in a suburb. Others look at much larger geographic landscapes such as metropolitan areas and urban regions (i.e., “macro” studies). (4) Urban sociologists can be optimistic about the prospects for urban places and people or, more frequently, pessimistic about how well they will fare. The resilience and effectiveness of people living in urban settings are more often subordinated to a view of them as part of a marginalized and less well-regarded group, surviving rather than accomplishing much in the places they live, work, and practice politics.</p>",sociology

From its inception, classical sociology was primarily concerned with the European origins of processes of modernity that were to become global. There was little discussion of how the global might be understood in terms of structures, processes and social movements not directly identified as European but nonetheless contributing to modernity. The challenge for sociology has been to take into account these other phenomena and to rethink its core categories and concepts in light of newly understood alternative formations of the global and the social movements that bring them about.",sociology

Peirce’s concepts, and in particular that which refers to the contextualized evolution of a sign ( semiosis), can remedy this situation by enriching the sociology of markets. Coordination between buyers and sellers is based on a process of transmission and reception of different types of signs: some are stabilized and the interpretation ‘flows naturally’ – these are the conventions well identified by economic sociologists – while others are more ambiguous and leave a great deal of room for indeterminacy. In the latter case, the concept of semiosis makes it possible to finely identify the techniques used by actors to buy or sell in situations of uncertainty. After presenting Peirce’s conceptual architecture, this article illustrates the interest of such an import from a case study centered on the role of stock market indices in the functioning of contemporary financial markets.",sociology
10.1177/0011392108097454,"If the conventional position that sociology emerged in the 19th century is accepted, then two 18th- and/or 19th-century rationalist knowledge conditions — `positivism gives way to theory' and `the centrality of modern rational philosophy' — can be accepted as the conventional knowledge conditions for the discipline's emergence. While acknowledging that this conventional position and these two conventional knowledge conditions form an important part of the story of sociology, this article argues that they should not be accepted as the whole story, or even as the most important part of it. The article presents two counter-arguments by way of a challenge to convention. The two arguments focus on the history of sociology's principal object, `the social'. One contends that the social actually emerged in the early modern era, not in the 19th century, and that, therefore, the discipline has its most significant roots in the period 1550—1700, especially in the work of thinkers more attuned to voluntarist factors. The second argument contends that sociology was only able to blossom as a discipline when the social achieved a significant level of autonomy from the three forces responsible for its emergence — politics, law and the state — something that did not happen until the late 19th century. On the back of these two arguments, the article develops a further argument: that sociology needs to extend its list of standard knowledge factors beyond the conventional two. This argument has it that while these two accurately reflect some important 18th- and 19th-century developments, they need to be supplemented by conditions that allowed the social to make the journey from the early modern era to the later era. The article then goes on to consider four different technologies for `seeing socially' — perspective, the microscope, the camera obscura and ballooning — as additional knowledge conditions for sociology.",sociology

10.1177/0038038597031004006,"Sociological reconceptualisations of the structure/agency divide have motivated important theoretical advances in the discipline, and the development of `structuration theories' and `analytical dualism' has promoted fresh thought about dominant views of the human agent. These approaches have sought to release sociology from any residual reliance on the oversocialised conception of the individual that formed part of the legacy of Parsonian sociology. It is the argument of this paper, however, that while structuration theory and analytical dualism focus on the creative powers of human reflexivity, as part of their rejection of the `oversocialised agent', the theoretical weight they place on consciousness neglects the socially shaped somatic bases of action and structure, and results in an undersocialised view of the embodied agent.  If the relationship between socialisation and agency needs analysing in terms of embodiment as much as in terms of the cognitive internalisation of norms and values, however, there are good reasons for structuration theory and analytical dualism rejecting attempts to ground subsequent notions of the embodied agent they may develop in dominant, static notions of the habitus. These minimise creativity and make it difficult to analyse social change. An important challenge for future reconceptualisations of the structure/agency divide, then, is to construct a sociology which recognises the significance for human agency of a socially shaped form of embodiment, yet which refuses to make the embodied actor a mere product of society.",sociology

Although such an approach is valuable, I propose that sociologists should pay attention also to the processes of meaning‐making that make up intellectual appeal on stage. In the second part of the paper, I argue that the sociology of intellectuals has been for too long obsessed with questions of success and prestige, and I propose that sociologists should shift their attention to the underappreciated and marginalised among intellectuals.",sociology

One of the most fully elaborated recent approaches in this area is the collective investigation by Ira Katznelson, Aristide Zolberg, and associates (1986). Conceptually, this approach follows Jürgen Kocka's Weberian-Marxist class model in reducing E. P. Thompson's cultural Marxist class notion to only one analytical level amongst others. I argue that this approach is limited its failure to adequately integrate the cultural and moral bases of working-class formation in relation to the legitimacy of the social order. I exemplify this criticism, first, by referring to the strength of Thompson's interpretative method in The Making of the English Working Class; second, by indicating some weaknesses of Jürgen Kocka's analytical method in his recent social history of the German working class; and third, by suggesting some comparative cultural hypotheses for explaining the different English and German patterns of working-class formation.",sociology

Through an analysis of five related processes: (1) changes in the drug economy; (2) proliferation of firearms; (3) similarity of cultural patterns of violence; (4) generalized fear among the population; and (5) citizen support for retaliation and extralegal violence (the latter in dangerous rapid expansion), the authors conclude by asserting that the appropriation of violence and its implacable logic of escalation can only lead to reciprocal annihilation.

It is assumed that sociology provides a better background for analysing and understanding economic institutions than economics itself. This is certainly true, but has led economic sociologists to treat economic theory as the ‘other’ of economic sociology. Thereby, the disciplinary boundary between economics and sociology is reproduced where economic sociology is understood the application of the ‘sociology tradition’ to economic phenomena. This article suggests a change of perspective: economic sociologists should treat economics as an endogenous part of its enquiries, but not to examine what economic theory is, but what it does, i.e. how economic theory shapes the economy. This requires introducing the study of language, concepts and semantic distinctions as an inherent part of economic sociology and its focus on the ‘social’ construction of economic institutions. Ultimately, this suggestion reorients our focus away from ‘authors’ to ‘concepts’. In other words, if economic sociology wants to take the ‘sociological’ and linguistic turn in social theory with its focus on language seriously, it needs to redefine its boundaries.",sociology

However, decolonial studies have long been the purview of the humanities and remain marginal to the social sciences due, partially, to a dearth of foundational theorizing.

Yet sociological theorists have barely scratched the surface of what philosophers who specialize in Dewey’s work such as Thomas Alexander and Richard Shusterman see as central to his thought, namely, his aesthetics. While in recent years some have drawn attention to Dewey’s aesthetics, this area of his work remains little known within sociology. Even less known is the extent to which Dewey’s aesthetics bears significant resemblances to the thought of Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914). I offer an exegesis of Dewey’s aesthetics, underscoring the roles of quality, emotion, and continuity in it and in Peircean thought alike. Understanding Dewey’s aesthetics in a Peircean key, I argue, calls for shifting theoretical attention from how people “problem solve” to get what they want or engage in “creative action” to transcend their situational constraints, to when, why, and how people, including sociologists ourselves, might engage problematic situations as mediums for transformation, as aesthetic experiences in potential.

The objective is to generate an original Critical Realist Model for Organizational Sociology. This initiative stems from critical realism’s critique of flat ontologies and epistemologies that tend to conflate different objects of reality. The proposed model takes the form of a trialectic generative sequence, highlighting driven objects configured in a specific ontological situation as the necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the emergence of organizations. This sequence includes (a) time-space co-presence and the embodiment process; (b) symbolic community sharing and the identification process; and (c) power dynamics and the processes of representation, delegation, and subordination. This model positions collective organized action as a fundamental intermediary concept for understanding organizations and collective action within a realistic social theory.

What does it mean to be “non-normative”? Ideally speaking, this connotation structures around a political claiming, a subversive metaphor that does not adhere to the standard gender(ed) expressions. That said, these gender traits challenge the cultural norms, or the dominant languages as historically coined within the medical dictionary. In order to address this, the politics further renders a non-foundationalist approach to gender, as making an attempt to de-objectify any sort of typification of classification. In addition, the diversity and fluidity of it aims to install de-pathologization of identity category, and further, to pacify the rigid gender traits that could potentially make gender more discrete. Thus, its very fluidity establishes an unsettling position of gender and sexual choices, as further to establish anti-imperial, non-hegemonic claim in the US-centric gender positions and theorizations. In lines to this argument, non-normative sexuality studies are an attempt to collate interdisciplinary and non–Euro-American modes of texts, theories, and approaches from the domains of culture, desire, beauty, aging, legalities, medicine, and health, complemented with several dimensions of these disciplines to create a bibliographical space addressing the several bodies, identities, and experiences of these representations.

Although processes of financialisation have meant that extreme indebtedness has been a latent global problem since the 1980s, it was only in the wake of the crash that debt became a manifest systemic issue. This was because it was no longer possible to endlessly defer repayment into the future on the basis of a fantasy of ceaseless growth because it suddenly became clear that the financial system was not good for the debts it had distributed across the globe. Given this crisis, endless finance and repayment projected into the distant future has been transformed into ‘the dead weight of debt’ and led to the emergence of a new class system based upon creditors and debtors. The emergence of this new situation challenges sociologists and policy-makers to think about possible solutions to the socio-economic horror of debt bondage that threatens to destroy the future of not only deeply indebted individuals and their families, but also generations to come who currently stand to inherit a decrepit society that seems hopelessly trapped between a fantasy of endless growth based in financial speculation and a dim recognition of the need for sustainability that finds violent rearticulation in austerity and common sense narratives about the need to balance the books.

We argue that this represents a shortcoming that should be addressed by future scholarship. In order to inform future critical gender–environment theorizing, we provide a brief review of ecofeminism and note promising examples of scholarship that takes power and inequality seriously when accounting for phenomena of relevance to women and the environment.

A critical review of recent social and historical studies of sound and technology, attending especially to debates surrounding the theoretical shift from acoustemological or soundscape‐based to signal‐oriented “transductive” approaches, suggests the importance for future STS and Sound Studies work of addressing how shared modes of sensory perception are produced within particular socio‐technical frames.",sociology

Ironically, just when globalisation has been growing in the world, so too have doubts about sociology as an international enterprise. This divergent development between the world and the discipline appears to be the direct result of the demise of positivism. Subsequent theorists have polarised into advocates of `false universalism', e.g. `modernisation theory', `dependency theory' and the post-modernist view of `modernity', all of which assume unitary processes with uniform results - to which international sociology stands opposed. Alternatively they have become celebrants of incommensurable diversity, resting on the assumptions of relativism, which would outlaw international sociology altogether. Instead of endorsing either unity or diversity, the task of international sociology is to specify how global mechanisms combine with regional circumstances, in non-uniform fashion, to shape new trajectories and novel configurations.

High‐profile risk incidents such as 9/11, the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans have served to underscore the global significance of risk. Although risk has conventionally been approached in the natural sciences as an object to be technically mastered by mathematical probability, since the early 1980s social scientists have focussed on the subjective and social dimensions of risk. This article traces the contours of the ‘turn to risk’ within sociology, outlining the central tenets of the risk society, governmentality and sociocultural theories. Both the utility of and the limits to these theories are demonstrated through practical application. The article concludes by considering some of the problems and contradictions that arise out of the sociological turn to risk.",sociology

He follows in the footsteps of Niklas Luhmann, yet in marked contrast with his ‘sociological master’ Baecker also gives ample attention to the notion of culture. This paper first summarizes some of the main lines in his writings on the notion of culture and on contemporary culture. It then continues with a succinct presentation of Baecker’s approach to artistic communication against the background of this more general characterization of the relationship between the individual and society, conscious sensory perception and communication, in terms of an ‘aesthetic coupling’. It will be shown that a recurrent figure of thought links up Baecker’s various considerations on culture and art, i.e. the inclusion of the excluded.",sociology

Here, we present a systematic review of peer-reviewed sociological articles on human–animal relationships since 1979. Our analysis identified key themes supporting charges of anthropocentrism, but also aspects of politicised animal sociology. Based on this we call for sociological animal studies to incorporate a specifically Emancipatory Animal Sociology: an approach grounded in a social justice and emancipatory praxis that explicitly and critically engages with the material conditions of animals’ lives, taking into account the experiences and knowledge of activists and others working directly with animals and, where possible, centres the animals themselves.",sociology

So it is not surprising that they have always been at the center of sociological research, starting with Marx and Weber. And although Durkheim did not explicitly analyze organizations, his work has clear implications for the study of organizations. We review the insights of these three pioneering sociologists and then discuss ideas about organizations proposed by other scholars, from both management and sociology, from 1910 to the mid‐1970s. Marx, Weber, and Durkheim's theoretical frameworks were tools for understanding the transition to modernity. Marx and Weber saw organizations as sites of class struggle and rationalization, respectively, while Durkheim focused on social cohesion and collective sensemaking, both of which underpin organizations. Later theorists focused more closely on the meso‐level and micro‐level processes that happen within and between organizations. These later theorists emphasized pragmatic concerns of optimizing organizational efficiency and labor productivity (scientific management and human relations theories), processes of affiliation and hierarchy (Simmel), limits to rational decision‐making (the Carnegie School), and environmental conditions that shape organizational processes and outcomes (contingency theories). A companion paper describes the three perspectives (demographic, relational, and cultural) that have dominated sociological research on organizations since the mid‐1970s.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0066,"<p>World-systems analysis (WSA) emerged in the stormy period between worldwide waves of protest in 1968 and the onset of transformative global economic crisis in 1973. Its founders Immanuel Wallerstein and Terence Hopkins, young sociologists of contemporary Africa in New York’s elite Columbia University, studied and worked with major social theorists of the previous generation: Karl Polanyi, Margaret Mead, C. Wright Mills, Daniel Bell, Seymour Martin Lipset, and Paul Lazarsfeld. WSA attacked modernization theory, the reigning political and intellectual orthodoxy of the era, which had predicted and prescribed the progression of all poorer countries and peoples toward the values and institutions of liberal capitalism, American style. Wallerstein and Hopkins argued that poorer countries and peoples were no less “modern” than wealthier ones. They became poor and dominated as a result of the same process of global formation, beginning with the 16th-century “discoveries,” through which selected Western countries obtained their wealth, advanced capabilities, and colonial empires. Undoing the benign assumptions of modernization as universally beneficial progress, WSA pointed to European imperialism as the main source of underdevelopment. Perceived backwardness derives not from old and stagnant local traditions, but rather from the axial division of labor between world zones unequal in wealth, status, and power: core, periphery, and semiperiphery in between. Expanding income, advanced skills, and citizenship rights in the core were historically supported by various forms of slavery and cheap labor across peripheral areas. WSA thus took neo-Marxian theories of capitalism, including arguments about its future demise, to the global plane. The hallmark of WSA is in shifting the principal unit of analysis from separately studied and case-independent “national” countries to the whole world analyzed as a single system containing various regions, markets, and states. WSA focused on globality long before globalization became fashionable. The radical “unthinking” of capitalist logic and “common sense” is the main claim of WSA. After a brief period of great popularity in the late 1970s, WSA was sidelined mainly for political reasons. The global financial upheaval of 2008, however, brought renewed interest in WSA. Its leading scholars, particularly Giovanni Arrighi and his collaborators, had anticipated this crisis by examining earlier instances of economic and geopolitical turbulence arising from world capitalist consolidations and transitional phases of systemic chaos. Other scholars also advanced WSA theories regarding ancient and medieval world-systems; environmental and economic geography; global cities; modern literature in the space of world creativity; the formation and undoing of labor markets; antisystemic movements; the specific mechanisms of capitalist operations such as commodity chains, race, and ethnic conflicts; the collapse of the Soviet empire and its outcomes; and the rise of East Asian industrialism. Moreover, the epistemology of knowledge became a special line of argument pointing to the blinders and institutional barriers that WSA seeks to overcome. In the early 21st century, world-systems analysis extends intellectual alliances in several directions, particularly with historical and political sociology, heterodox economics, and the political economy of culture.</p>",sociology

The gender pay gap can refer to differences in mean or median annual earnings, weekly earnings, or hourly wage. Because women tend to work part-time at higher rates than do men, and because part-time work tends to pay lower hourly wages relative to full-time work, the size of the gender pay gap is affected by whether full- and part-time, full-year or seasonal, and very young and very old workers are included in the estimates. Among full-time, year-round American workers aged sixteen and above in 2017, the gender pay gap (median weekly earnings) was 18.2 percent, meaning that women earned 81.8 cents of every man’s dollar. In the United States, women of color earn less relative to white men than white women do, owing to racial gaps in pay among women; moreover, within-race gender pay gaps are often smaller among racial/ethnic minorities, reflecting the low earnings of minority men. The gender gap has narrowed considerably since the early 20th century, yet disparities in women’s and men’s earnings persist. Moreover, this narrowing has not proceeded in a linear fashion and the gap has occasionally increased. This entry first introduces important literatures on historic and contemporary trends in the gender pay gap and then discusses the various explanations for the persistence of, and changes in, the gap. These explanations highlight the role of occupational gender segregation; the devaluation of female-typed work; gender differences in experience; family structure, care responsibilities, and the gendered impact of parenthood; workplace structures of inequality; glass ceilings and glass escalators.

While there are many viable ways to embed corruption, we advocate a comparative historical sociology of corruption in particular. This approach has in mind a view of corruption as “a moving object,” that is, as subject to variation across social space and transformation over time. It focuses on the processes through which a course of action is worked out in relation to historically specific structural conditions. By tracing these processes and embedding “corrupt” practices in the situations where they were developed and make sense, we gain a deeper understanding of these practices and are in a better position to evaluate them. We are also able to make better comparisons, comparing objects shaped by similar processes rather than objects identified by definition alone. We proceed, first, by situating our intervention in the context of the rise of a disembedded approach to corruption. Second, we review a selection of more or less embedded approaches in anthropology and sociology. Third, we describe what a comparative historical sociology of corruption entails. Finally, we highlight the costs of a disembedded view in terms of ineffective and pathologizing anti‐corruption efforts.",sociology

Theoretical approaches to personhood attempt to respond to these changed conditions, with the work of Pierre Bourdieu often thought incapable of properly explaining such contemporary phenomena. In response, this article approaches personhood through the frame of Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic capital, those properties ‘misrecognized’ as belonging to the person when they are in fact the product of relations in which the person is enmeshed. A reconstruction of the concept in the sociologist’s work, along with analyses of its implications for a philosophy of perception and for ideology, will show the way for an unexpected approach both to Bourdieu’s own work, reframed through the concept of symbolic capital, and to personhood, which is revealed to be a profoundly and paradoxically relational notion.",sociology

Between these two poles, considerations of the social relativity of scientific knowledge arise.

Hierarchical theories such as Marxism suggest that public sociology is torn by the irreconcilable contradiction between hegemony and counter-hegemony. Heterarchical theories address both of these two problems together. Heterarchy suggests that science’s claim to universality may interfere with public sociology’s social-transformative aspirations.

Social control and cohesion, differentiation and inequality, collective action, power and influence, and identity formation are just a few of the topics considered by sociologists studying occupations and professions. Four strands of literature compose the sociology of occupations and professions, broadly defined. One strand tackles the division of labor, with the goal of understanding how positions in the division of labor are differentiated from one another (e.g., professions from other occupations), and how those differences are maintained. A second examines occupational communities, and, in particular, the relationship between occupational membership and individual behavior. A third strand focuses on the social activity of work itself, including the labor process, employer control of work, alienation and job satisfaction, unionization and its recent discontents, and the rise and fall of skills. Another thread of scholarship considers how occupations become associated with rewards (e.g., pay, prestige, authority, etc.). The field of occupations and professions has diversified methodologically in recent years, opening up new modes of inquiry into some of these topics. Indeed, whereas case studies of particular occupations dominated the field in the latter half of the 20th century, major empirical research in the last decade have included ethnographies, comparative case studies, network analyses, and quantitative analyses of survey data. And, although the pace of theoretical innovation in the “professions” literature may have slowed in recent years, the field remains a vibrant arena for studies of globalization, technological change, corporate reorganization and changes in employment practices, and the emergence of “new” types of work (e.g., service work, emotional labor).</p>",sociology

In the article, a general understanding of humor and satire outside of a political context, followed by an overview of studies discussing humor and satire in politics through their applications in social movements, as leadership tools, and through their manifestations in mass media has been presented. Lastly, a cultural sociological perspective to the field has been introduced. It has been argued that approaching humor and satire in politics through a structural hermeneutic method of the Strong Program will enable us to recognize and treat political humor and satire as autonomous and complex cultural systems which carry an internal power to move people.",sociology
10.1177/0038038582016002004,"The paper explores some of the main strands in the development of the sociology of leisure. The nineteenth century founding fathers, with their synoptic theoretical approaches, found space for leisure, although not labelled as such, as an integral part of their work. Veblen introduced the concept of leisure into sociology, but was himself committed to values of efficiency from which standpoint he criticized the drone-like character of the leisure class. His views were more consonant with industrial sociology which emerged as a strong well-funded sub-discipline dedicated to humanize the labour process while also maximizing productivity. It was from among industrial sociologists seeking a fuller explanation of work-place behaviour by looking beyond the factory that a sociology of leisure was developed. It emerged as a satellite to the sociology of work. The sociology of leisure was dominated, in the post-Second World War period, on the one hand by post-industrialism, and on the other hand by data collection, often on a psychologistic and individualistic basis. The reaction has been to return to more synoptic approaches, often combining elements of marxism, culturalism, history and literary criticism. These approaches have also redressed the balance against the notion that leisure is always a symbol of freedom and progress by re-introducing notions of constraint and social control. In conclusion, it is pointed out that leisure, deriving from the latin `licere', properly incorporates both of these meanings, and therefore raises in another form a fundamental problem of sociology itself. The problem concerns the balance between the individual and the social and between freedom and constraint. In this sense, leisure should be treated as an important and integral part of sociology, and not peripheral.",sociology

The article explores a number of respects in which Musil’s writing can be seen as ironizing our frequent perception of modernity as dominated by the evils of alienation, anonymity, fragmentation and occupational specialization, by exposing the extent to which this perception expresses elements of naïvety and complacency inherent in classical European humanistic discourses centring on values of Bildung and the ‘many-sided personality’.",sociology

Narrativity is embedded within much contemporary sociological work, and sociologists and novelists share a number of complementary approaches for understanding and interpreting the social world. This article argues that novel writing presents sociologists with a process and medium through which they can expand their work for a more public, engaging, affective, and panoramic sociology. Here, the historical development of sociological thought is considered as well as the recent progress of public sociology. Three key strengths of sociological novels are presented: promoting public sociology and interlocutor engagement; transforming knowledge exchange from mimetic to sympractic communication; and addressing issues of scope. Two recent sociological novels are discussed: Blue by Patricia Leavy and On The Cusp by David Buckingham, both published in 2015. Finally, two linked aspects for (thinking about) writing sociological fiction are explored: the concept of glocality and the methodology of ethnography. Employing creative mediums such as novels as public sociology may cultivate a wider, affective public engagement with significant academic ideas such as the sociological imagination. Sociological novels work to bring the local and global into dialogue, and may help achieve the scope and panoramic depth that sociology requires.",sociology
10.1177/0038038504040869,"Scholarly activity presupposes a certain distance from the concerns of everyday life, which has both liberating and crippling effects. Bourdieu’s reflexive sociology hopes to undo these crippling effects by making the scholar aware of the limits of his/her ‘liberation’. Through his emphasis on the practical content of social life, Bourdieu provides a powerful alternative to theoretical critiques of contemporary society advanced by sociologists such as Adorno. At the same time, read against the background of Adorno’s ‘critical theory’, this reflexive move itself appears as a limitation. Due to its emphasis on the conditions of sociological knowledge, reflexive sociology tends to subordinate ‘theory’ to ‘epistemology’ and, therefore, hinders the sociologist from imagining a different society. Read together, Bourdieu’s and Adorno’s works provide important insights about two potential dangers that remain on the path of the sociologist. Adorno’s critique of ‘scientism’ implies that adhering to an epistemological principle may not be enough to escape the ‘ fallacious’ representations of social reality, while Bourdieu’s critique of ‘theoreticism’ implies that one cannot grasp social reality without ‘touching’ it.",sociology

The latter has emphasised a discursive shift in psychiatry since Victorian times, from brain to mind, from coercion to voluntarism, and from hospital to community.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0247,"<p>Pioneering work on the relationship between race and sexuality can be dated from the late 1970s. Early academic, political, and artistic work by women of color in particular gave voice to women’s simultaneous experiences of heterosexism, racism, sexism, and so on. Queer of color work broadly theorized the role of race and racism in knowledge, politics, and concepts of sexualities. Historical work on empire, slavery, and colonialism further demonstrated this fact, while contemporarily focused transnational work does the same for early-21st-century processes. Given the importance of intersectional and transnational analysis, research on race and sexuality has become a growing and central feature of sexuality studies. Such research does not treat “whiteness” as a taken-for-granted category of analysis, but instead unpacks how sex, sexuality, and race are always co-constituted. With emerging theoretical lenses such as Queer of Color Critique, the study of racialized sexualities has become crucial to any exploration of sexuality. In addition, studies of race and sexuality look at how they have historically informed and continue to inform one another, in ways that include thinking about empire, Racisms, carcerality, surveillance, criminology, deviance, desire, and changing understanding of the erotic. Both intersectional and transnational work consider multiple racial formations and take into account the multiple genealogies of sexuality studies, centralizing work that is informed by women of color feminisms, transnational feminisms, queer theory, and black feminist thought. To best understand racial and sexual formations, race and sexuality studies allow us to think of the two as always informing one another.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0264,"<p>The subject of urban crime has long fascinated researchers, policymakers, social workers, journalists, and the public. Historically, the subject of crime has been so linked to urban places that the very mention of cities has evoked images of violent slums and fear of victimization. It is common for government officials to publicly politicize and racialize urban crime as they pander to certain blocks of voters. For instance, among his many derogatory comments about cities and urban populations, former US President Donald Trump—a New Yorker—tweeted about needing help with “crime-infested inner-cities.” Why the emphasis on crime in cities? A main reason is that crime is not randomly distributed. Rather, environmental opportunities for crime vary by time and place, and cities tend to have characteristics that increase vulnerability to crime. Though cities vary along many dimensions, including culture, climate, history, politics, and demographic characteristics (e.g., population size, density, racial and ethnic heterogeneity, age structure, and migration patterns), crime rates historically have been higher in urban communities than in rural, suburban, and smaller-sized places, on average. For this reason, many consider cities to be the ideal social laboratory for studying crime. Urban sociology has been essential to the theory and research on crime as a place-based social problem. Research on the spatial distribution of crime has compared different levels and scales of analysis, including samples of cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and neighborhoods (as defined by residents, researchers, or administrative census boundaries). Many studies focus on a single city, or even a single neighborhood. In addition, the urban crime literature covers topics that are quite varied, including different place-based theoretical approaches, concepts, explanations of causes and consequences, and policies. For example, researchers have explored topics related to the impact of neighborhood residential mobility on crime, the consequences of residents’ experiences with crime on their sense of neighborhood attachment, and the ways in which crime control policies affect the distribution of crime and residents’ lives. The books and articles outlined below are not exhaustive, but instead we view them as a curated sampling of the vast range of research on these topics—simply one of many ways to organize the vast amount of work that has accumulated on the important but broad subject of cities and crime. We respectfully acknowledge that this summary is focused on the United States and that many subtopics relevant to urban crime necessarily have been omitted because of space constraints but deserve their own bibliographies to be drafted by experts in those subfields.</p>",sociology

The popularity of these unscripted programs merits investigation. Reality shows can be seen as significant cultural objects whose production and consumption reflect and reveal norms and ideologies of contemporary culture. Although what is currently conceived as the reality television genre is perceived as novel, this type of programming has a long history, with its foundations dating back to the early days of television. Despite the popularity of reality television and its solid roots in Western media, sociology has been underused in its analysis. In this essay, I review the research on reality television. Its definition, history, and issues of classification in the genre are addressed. Then, I summarize the major themes in the research: production; analysis of content, presentations of race, gender, and sexuality; and audience response and interaction. I conclude with a discussion of what sociology might add to the existing research.What are sociologists to make of the current wave of reality television? What do these shows and their popularity tell us about society? Despite the editing and packaging of these shows and the way people are turned into television‐friendly characters and prototypes, these programs bear similarities to social research. Many are explicitly or implicitly promoted as ‘social experiments’. Reality shows often cast relatively diverse groups with the intention of seeing whether conflict or harmony will result. Success in reality competitions is often achieved through the development of alliances and strategic relationships and the process by which these unions form can be sociologically fascinating to watch. Yet, sociology, in method and theory, has rarely been applied to the analysis of reality television. This is not to say that reality television has not been examined academically. In fact, there is a growing body of research, primarily conducted by communication studies scholars, that takes this type of television seriously.Research on reality television examines the production and reception of programs. Additionally, there are studies that document the significance of the popularity of this genre in television and popular culture. Other research analyzes the content of reality television, aiming to make sense of communication norms depicted on shows like <jats:italic>Survivor</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Big Brother</jats:italic>. Although many of the articles and books about reality television investigate themes with which sociologists are quite familiar (e.g., identity, stereotypes, social structure), missing from most of the current analyses is systematic use of rigorous sociological methodology, perspective, and theory. Sociology could contribute a great deal to the study of reality television. Certainly, a microsociological, symbolic interactionist analysis of both the content of reality shows and the ways viewers interact with them would be a useful extension to the existing literature. Sociologists have done rich ethnographic research in the study of talk shows (e.g., <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b1"">Abt and Mustazza 1997</jats:ext-link>; <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b30"">Gamson 1998</jats:ext-link>; <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b35"">Grindstaff 2002</jats:ext-link>), and it would be beneficial to have an in‐depth, inside look at the production of reality television, particularly given that its reality is contested. Additionally, sociologists could provide important perspective regarding how reality programming reflects, challenges, and perpetuates existing inequalities, particularly with respect to race, class, gender, and sexuality. A critical understanding of the impact of social structure on popular culture, from a sociological point of view, would add another dimension to the study of reality television, continuing the strong tradition in research on culture that demonstrates how cultural objects have much to tell about social life, values, and ideologies.Sociology has been used to make critical contributions to the study of television. As <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b34"">Grindstaff and Turow (2006</jats:ext-link>) note, sociologists have been instrumental in documenting the significance of television as an industry and important part of the economy, and as a primary medium of distribution of mass cultural products. television has unified generations of Americans, creating media events and spectacles, shaping and reflecting changing norms and conceptions of reality (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#b22"">Dayan and Katz 1994</jats:ext-link>).

Bibliometric analyses are among the techniques that the government uses to evaluate the quality of research performance. Like many other disciplines, sociology is a target of these assessments. This paper presents data to demonstrate how Australian sociology might measure up if subjected to an inquiry using these methods. Data are provided on the standing of Australian sociology internationally and on the research contributions of major Australian universities. Several important methodological issues are reviewed and discussed. It is concluded that Australian sociologists would be well served by becoming active participants in the ongoing national debate over the assessment of research performance and the allocation of funding for tertiary education and science.",sociology

In this article, based on a relational conceptualization of value, the author calls for a value turn that could open childhood theorization both to new forms of cultural analysis of social processes at the familial, national, and global scales, and to new forms of applied research on policy fronts such as childcare and education policies, civil society engagement, and parenting.

Two central directives can be gleaned from this vision: to tackle macro social theory issues by doing large-scope research; to achieve scholastic independence by doing non-administrative research. One might ask if Mills is sending scholars on a mission impossible. Analysing these two concepts in terms of both their merits and applicability, the present article indeed identifies a conflict between them, highlighted by what emerges as Mills’ own failure to realize this vision. After deeming these directives worthy goals, the article seeks to determine whether technological advances in the social sciences have the potential to allow both directives to be fulfilled at once. What is shown is that while the technology is ripe to enable autonomous big studies, its implementation by institutional and individual agents severely impedes the vision’s realization.",sociology

In lieu of this, the authors propose an approach that focuses upon social subjectivization and its accompanying matrices of domination. Social movements are therefore more than manifestations of structural conflicts. They participate in the formation of subjects. Central to the views expressed in this article is the subject’s relation to self as a bifurcated process, one that has broken with the reassurances of state and society.

These developments, it is argued here, actually created the form of the social that became large-scale modern western society. This new form of the social was and remains distinct from those older forms that were seen to flow from the natural sociality of human beings. Between the middle of the 16th century and the end of the 17th the new form of the social emerged in different parts of Europe, contingently but not entirely accidentally, as a separate domain of relatively safe and free human interaction. It was a consequence — in part intended, in part unintended — of different bids to secure civil peace in times of extreme inter-communal, inter-confessional violence. These bids included, to name just three measures: the development of new forms of public law, especially in Germany; the development of the absolutist state, especially in France; and the separation of private religious conscience from public legal conscience, especially in England. As they were all, in one way or another, steps towards stemming, stopping, and/or preventing the flow of blood caused by religious hatreds, they are here called early modern limiting measures, and the social at the centre of the article is sometimes called the limited social or limited society.",sociology

While this institutionalization is recognized to have been advanced primarily by Arthur Ruppin, there is growing agreement among historians that several authors working more or less parallel to Ruppin greatly contributed to the emergence of the field in Italy, Russia, Great Britain, and Germany and to the emergence of a vast body of research in German, Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew. Although the boundaries between European sociological discourses (e.g., Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss in France or Georg Simmel in Germany) and Jewish sociology are not always stable, scholars widely assent that European Jewish sociology denotes the study of contemporary Jewry with the tools of modern social science. Historians have also documented the unstable boundaries between European and American Jewish sociology (e.g., Max Weinreich, Maurice Fishberg, or Joseph Jacobs). Scholars also agree that similarly to broader trends in Europe connected to the emergence of nationalism, its general context was that of attempts to employ scientific tools for the rationalization of society, and more specifically for finding solutions to social tensions and problems. As such, its generators viewed its primary aim to study and understand the condition and future tendencies of Jews in modern non-Jewish-majority societies. In particular, this included degrees of assimilation of Jews into non-Jewish societies and the measurement of anti-Semitic hostility toward Jews. In comparison with other branches of sociology, Jewish sociology tended to focus on empirical questions and showed less interest in general theoretical or methodological concerns. With Ruppin’s immigration to Palestine in 1908 and his position as a professor of sociology (1926–1943) at the newly established Hebrew University, the center of European Jewish sociology shifted to Palestine. Studies in the field were continued by some of Ruppin’s prominent former students.</p>",sociology

New ways of making violence visible unsettle old notions of the nature and direction of violence; challenging assumptions that the disadvantaged are more violent than the powerful; and that modernity is increasingly less violent.

In particular, Crow fails to consider the explicit use of the concept of strategy in two key areas of social life - the military and business organisation. Had he considered these areas, he would have noted that the concept of strategy needs understanding in terms of its role in reproducing specific sets of hierarchically organised social relations.

To minimize the risk associated with innovation, most scholars agree that firms should engage simultaneously in two types of activities: exploring new alternatives and exploiting existing competencies. Firms that simultaneously engage in explorative and exploitative activities are called ambidextrous organizations. Research on ambidextrous organizations, however, inadequately considers the importance of the environment in which organizations operate for innovation success. The sociological view of innovation fills this gap by emphasizing the importance of social context for explaining innovative outcomes. The sociology of innovation highlights, first, the structural arrangements – characteristics of social networks, organizations, and institutions – that influence innovation and, second, the relative nature of innovation – whether an object is considered novel depends on one's vantage point. Drawing on the relative view of innovation, I develop a typology that outlines several paths to innovation with respect to two vantage points: the organization and the environment. I argue that minimizing the risks associated with innovation is most likely to occur when firms follow the path of innovation that consists of generating novel solutions that simultaneously exploit knowledge and resources that are both available to the firm<jats:italic>and</jats:italic>in the firm's environment.",sociology

Recent years have, however, witnessed no little debate amongst music sociologists about the broader purchase and value of such scholarship, especially considering its apparent challenge to Bourdieu’s critical cultural sociology. This article seeks to contribute to debates in this area by advocating a novel approach to questions about music’s relation to the social, one that seeks less to map the social distribution of taste profiles or explore how listeners make use of music’s affordances than understand the variable ways in which music emerges as something to be attended to (or not) in the first place. Drawing on recent work in relational sociology, the mature philosophy of pragmatist John Dewey as well as new materialist thought, this article explores the potential of a trans-actional prospectus for music sociology. This is an approach that advocates a ‘flat’ social ontology in order to focus on questions about the constitution and configuration of musical events. In so doing, the article argues that if we are to gain a better understanding of music’s varied relation to the social, it is necessary to transcend the residual substantialism implicit in ‘new sociology’ and mediation-focused accounts and adopt an approach capable of integrating concerns of object-ness, emergence and attention with questions of power and inequality.",sociology

One implication is the ambiguous position of children, hanging between the private and the public domain, implying specific tensions and dilemmas. Two issues are significant: the division of responsibility for children between parents and collective institutions; and the search of parents and other educators — peers included — to find a balance between external social control and self-control in the formation of the personality of children.

Since the 1990s, sociological research has included the legal and political bases of children’s citizenship and rights, forms of interaction promoting children’s participation, ways of including children in mainstream cultural tendencies, children’s observations of their social context, intercultural situations involving children, deviance and the labelling of children. The expansion of childhood sociology, however, has been slow, and the political impulse which supported children’s participation has partially evaporated.

The goal is to demonstrate the relevance of Durkheim’s late work in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life for global analysis as well as to point to some limitations in the way it has been employed by contemporary cultural sociologists. A core limitation is a tendency to balance theorization away from issues of power and politics. Three themes of power and politics of/in global injustice symbols are treated: (1) the way symbolic processes involve amnesia and idolization; (2) how they revolve around meaning adaptation and self-celebration on the part of symbolizing agents; and (3) their implication in de-symbolizing and re-symbolizing activities.

This paper takes up the debate about the mechanisms of containment with reference to a neglected aspect—the process of ideology production itself. It is suggested that the symbolic structure of radical ideologies may be understood as the outcome of three conceptual processes: (1) de-legitimation; (2) dis-alienation; (3) `commutation' or communication/interaction. The ideological product may also be evaluated, in sociological terms, as a theoretical and empirical response to determinate social problems. Two recent examples are used to illustrate the main lines of such an analysis: the International Marxist Group in Britain, and Students for a Democratic Society in the USA. They indicate that the internal, conceptual requirements of a radical ideology, and especially the need to publicly present and validate ideological knowledge, may distort the social analysis in ways which render it less effective as a force for political mobilization, and therefore magnify the effects of more familiar structural constraints on radical movements.",sociology

In the early stages of childhood studies there was a synchrony between the orientation of the new social studies of childhood in the UK and changes in how children came to be politically positioned, particularly with respect to an emphasis on children’s voices, their capacity to be agentic and their status as social actors. Since then the political status of childhood has become more problematic.

Existing sociological and feminist work is suggestive of themes which the paper seeks to develop: the distinction commonly made between being `in love' and love as longer term affection, the mysterious power accorded to the former emotion, the contradictions between these two forms of love and the ways in which the ideology of romance has been associated with women's subordination. As a means of theorising these aspects of love, a conceptualisation of subjectivity as constituted through narrative or discourse is considered.

Two actors participated in the animating discourse of caste and race in the annals of American sociology.

Instead, he advocated for a racialized system to understand the post-slavery capitalist America. Gerald Berreman represented a different camp that found social hierarchies to be co-determinant of relations and division arranged into a caste society. The debate over caste, nevertheless, admitted to the plausibility of castes contrasted with India’s caste system. However, caste categorization was found to be an appropriate application to the conditions of social inequalities. Gunnar Myrdal and other scholars of repute contributed to the debate. What remained limited in their theoretical contributions to the discussion was an inadequate focus on the lived reality and politics of the caste formulations in the postcolonial, socialist mode of production. A serious examination of untouchability, sub-castes and sub-sub-castes that regulate the kernel of the caste system as well as the racialized castes in India were not studied or referenced in detail.

This article seeks to contribute in three ways to recent initiatives promoting public sociology. First, by developing a broader concept of engaged social science that includes public sociology and policy or applied sociology, which solves specific social problems. Second, by suggesting ways to move toward greater engagement. Projects centered on creating new theory, the core work of professional sociology, can incorporate elements of engaged work. Policyoriented projects can grow to include the larger dialogues of public sociology. Third, by suggesting ways to manage tensions and create synergies between professional and engaged social science. These ideas are based on a project on community organizing that includes professional research and partnerships centered on policy and public sociology. The article concludes that the movement for more engaged social science should connect with similar initiatives outside the discipline if it is to be effective at individual and institutional levels.",sociology

The association of modernity with Europe (and with a European history limited to the self-identified boundaries of the continent) is commonplace and pervasive within the social sciences and humanities. What such an understanding fails to take into consideration, however, are the connections between Europe and the rest of the world that constitute the broader context for the emergence of what is understood to be the modern world and its institutions, such as the state and market. In this article, I suggest that integral to this misunderstanding, and its reproduction over time, is the methodology of comparative historical sociology as represented by ideal types.

In the present essay a reading of `mainstream' English Puritan writings on the calling is presented, and Weber's representation of the idea is found to be accurate except for an exaggeration of its asceticism, probably due to Weber's reliance on post-Civil War sources. The Puritan themes of chance, proof, and control are then shown to be prominent in Weber's usage of Chancen to define social action and institutions, and fundamental to the method of interpretive sociology. The rationalist biases of Weber's work, the problematic formal-substantive distinction, and Weber's justification of ideal-typical analysis are assessed in terms of the Puritan Berufsmensch who `neither inquires about nor finds it necessary to inquire about the meaning of his actual practice of a vocation within the whole world, the total framework of which is not his responsibility, but his God's'.",sociology

Throughout this paper, I explore how the aesthetic approach engages with critical theory and contributes to the sociology of media and communication. For this, I will theoretically survey the terms of sociality under the forces of immediate communication, ubiquitous surveillance, and the compression of time and space that Baudrillard and Virilio once problematized through the lens of critical technology theory to adapt it to media and communication studies. I contend that techno-aesthetics that converge with Rancière’s dissensus can provide practical suggestions on an updated vocation of critical sociology.

Studies of urban experiences have recently begun to flourish due, in part, to the rise of sensory scholarship. Recognizing the connections between urban experiences and sensory stimulations provides nuanced ways to explore the actions and interactions between individuals and their relationships to and with urban places. Relying on a diverse literature of recent studies that focus on cities as dense sensory environments, this article shows the significance of studying city life at the experiential and sensory levels. First, a few seminal early works are discussed, with specific emphasis on Georg Simmel. Then, each of the five bodily senses and their correlated sensescapes – seescapes, soundscapes, smellscapes, tastescapes, and touchscapes – are presented in order to show individuals and groups use their senses to experience and make sense of the city.

By providing details of a funded study of this sector in three cities (London, Berlin and Milan), the article also proposes a utilising of the recent role of the so-called entrepreneurial university as creative hub, so as to develop a more radical idea of ‘knowledge transfer’. In addition, the article encourages a two-way exchange between sociology and creative industry studies to develop a better understanding of cultural goods, items and works of art.

While historically they have not been in dialog with each other, when taken together sociological research on youth status relations and social networks, systemic bias, school culture and social ecology can lay the foundation of a sociology of bullying.

A review of the journal’s content from that era reveals a surprising dearth of work on the politics of group identity.

Through sophisticated use of theory, research and case studies many of the articles included in the e-special challenge the simplifications of this thesis. The selected articles are grouped in four sections: the first looks at attempts to theorize self-identity in late modernity; this is followed by three articles on consumerism and lifestyle; the next section contains articles on biography and the life course.

This originates from the high degree of freedom given to the use of sources in the historical study of collective consciousness. Accordingly, it was easy to accept the impact of the linguistic turn. Subsequently, Japanese historical sociology evolved into discourse-historical research, media-historical research, and constructionist-historical research. In recent years, historical research on social issues and quantitative historical sociology have become increasingly popular.

Human nature is seen as a set of drives and capacities, which play a key role in people’s actions in any social context. In the textbooks, a variety of arguments suggest the irrelevance of a concept of human nature to the discipline. Partly, this message is conveyed by opposing social to biological explanations. In addition, the discipline is framed to exclude the concept of human nature. Society, on the one hand, and the culturally unique individual, on the other, exhaust the sociological arena. Accounts of socialization imply the transcendence of biology and with that, human nature. Refutations of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are supported with broad ranging rejections of biological explanation, with a similar implication that human nature is not a necessary concept in sociological accounts. Nevertheless, human nature is the elephant in the room. The concept is required and assumed in the detail of these textbooks as they explain current sociological research and analysis.

With increasing specialization in the field of knowledge in the course of the 20th century there was a neglect of social institutions in orthodox economic analysis and a parallel relative neglect of economic phenomena within sociological analysis. The latter condition has been exacerbated by the ‘cultural turn’ in social thought that took place towards the close of the century, ironically a period marked by the growing prominence of economic matters in social and political life. This paper presents an argument for a return to the analytic concern with economic life that lies at the heart of classical sociology, for an ‘economic turn’ in contemporary sociological thought. This is achieved through a discussion of the work of J.K.

Influenced by five exceptionally learned and lucid sociologists – John Rex, Herminio Martins, Raymond Williams, Pierre Bourdieu and Terry Lovell – she has spent her sociological career contributing to the demystification of power in various forms. In particular she has focused on the significance of secular culture – notably literature – in creating hegemonic domination. She has also analysed the role of symbolic revolutions in social transformation, avoiding in this respect falling either into idealism or simplistic class reductionism. Arguing that sociological theory still needs to teach Marx, Weber and Durkheim, these founding figures should not be seen as creating – in social scientific terms – a unified architectural construction, but should be read with and against one another; further, they need also to be combined with other, more contemporary, influences. Finally whilst noting the existential salience of movements around identity – nation, gender, sexuality and disability – she argues that the discipline must continue to reach out ‘beyond the fragments’, to address social totalities more broadly, including wider issues of social space and structures of power.",sociology

To minimize the risk associated with innovation, most scholars agree that firms should engage simultaneously in two types of activities: exploring new alternatives and exploiting existing competencies. Firms that simultaneously engage in explorative and exploitative activities are called ambidextrous organizations. Research on ambidextrous organizations, however, inadequately considers the importance of the environment in which organizations operate for innovation success. The sociological view of innovation fills this gap by emphasizing the importance of social context for explaining innovative outcomes. The sociology of innovation highlights, first, the structural arrangements – characteristics of social networks, organizations, and institutions – that influence innovation and, second, the relative nature of innovation – whether an object is considered novel depends on one's vantage point. Drawing on the relative view of innovation, I develop a typology that outlines several paths to innovation with respect to two vantage points: the organization and the environment. I argue that minimizing the risks associated with innovation is most likely to occur when firms follow the path of innovation that consists of generating novel solutions that simultaneously exploit knowledge and resources that are both available to the firm<jats:italic>and</jats:italic>in the firm's environment.",sociology

In particular, Crow fails to consider the explicit use of the concept of strategy in two key areas of social life - the military and business organisation. Had he considered these areas, he would have noted that the concept of strategy needs understanding in terms of its role in reproducing specific sets of hierarchically organised social relations. We argue that utilising the concept of strategy in other areas of social life has similar power effects.

New ways of making violence visible unsettle old notions of the nature and direction of violence; challenging assumptions that the disadvantaged are more violent than the powerful; and that modernity is increasingly less violent.

The differences Bourdieu identifies as signifying classes do so only as arbitrary signs and not because of any intrinsic qualities. Furthermore, it is argued that this relational logic is a necessary completion in Bourdieu’s analysis, because of his rejection of Kantian aesthetics, in which an immediate understanding of intrinsic quality is a central point. Both the Kantian and the Saussurean influence are given in the title and subtitle of his work: Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.

The paper argues that this is the case because of its common historical-cultural heritage and because of the increasing density of direct interrelationships between its nations and peoples.  Nevertheless, internal differentiations continue to make of this `continent' one of the most complex and variegated culture areas in the world. Three dimensions are of particular relevance in this regard: (a) the level of socio-economic development; (b) linguistic-cultural and religious traditions; (c) the type of political system. If we allocate 25 of the larger European nation-states to this 3-dimensional typology, we can demonstrate a limited number of relatively internally homogeneous clusters of nations. These are distinguished from each other not only in terms of political system, but also in terms of socio-economic development, language and religion.

The interdisciplinary nature of this topic has resulted in scholarship on many different aspects of the body across the life course. The works included here are foundational to knowledge about the gendered body and particularly the sociology of the body. Moreover, they exhibit intersectionality and begin with the assumption that social constructs such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, age, and dis/ability intersect with gender to shape life experiences, social outcomes, and self-concept. While there are many areas that fall under the topic of gender and bodies (such as medicalization, sport, disability, gendered violence, sexual practices, and eating disorders) this article focuses particularly on theory and research on the social construction of female and male bodies, as well as bodies that disrupt sex, gender, and sexuality binaries, i.e., intersex and LGBTQ Bodies. Specifically, there is an abundance of scholarship that examines how social and cultural structures patrol normative femininities and hegemonic masculinities thereby reinforcing binary understandings of sex and gender. Nonetheless, there is some work that emphasizes the undoing of gender, social activism, and embodied resistance. Writings on gendered constructs and the body also examine how some bodies are privileged over others, showing a body hierarchy based on, for example, beauty, skin tone, and body size that furnishes some people with physical capital while disadvantaging others.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0223,"<p>The term “professions” generally refers to occupations that require expertise obtainable only through specialized training and credentialed by advanced degrees or licenses. Examples include academia, medicine, law, engineering, the clergy, and accountancy. The professions generally provide greater social prestige relative to other occupations. Moreover, professionals determine the scope of their work, the requisite level of expertise, and the terms of inclusion. Much of the research on gender and professions highlights the structural barriers to entry and advancement by women. Because the professions developed from endeavors long considered “gentlemanly vocations,” they were historically dominated by men. Most universities prohibited women from matriculating until the mid-1800s, allowing few to obtain the advanced education required for the professions. By excluding women from highly rewarded roles, the professions have long produced and maintained gender inequalities, particularly the Wage Gap. Over recent decades, women have entered the professions in growing numbers. In some cases, such as veterinary medicine, women have even overtaken men numerically, resulting in the feminization of the field. Salaries in feminized professions, or sectors of a profession, are generally lower than are those in fields with fewer women. The explanations offered for this wage gap involve devaluation or queuing. The devaluation view argues that the sex composition of a profession affects the salary offered. Because of gender bias, employers devalue work done by women. Consequently, they lower the rewards in occupations numerically dominated by women. This is particularly the case for professions involving emotional labor and care work. In the queuing view, the salary levels of a profession affect its gender composition. Although both men and women prefer to work in higher paid professions, employers prefer to hire men for high-reward positions. This suggests a gendered labor queue consisting of men, leaving women clustered in professions offering lower pay. In research on other topics, different definitions of “gender” lead to varying perspectives on its implications for the professions. When understood as a set of attributes associated with biological sex, research emphasizes the sex-typing of skills and sex-based differences within professions. When understood as a relation that influences interactions and identities, research investigates how gender informs the daily functioning of the workplace in various ways, producing professional cultures that create formal or informal barriers and advantages.</p>",sociology

This body of scholarship documents both similarity and difference between the health experience of men and women across the life course. Gender-based health patterns are dependent upon the health outcome examined, as life expectancy is shorter among men while women experience higher rates of various non-fatal functional problems and chronic medical conditions. Gender differences also exist in mental health outcomes and participation in various healthy and unhealthy behaviors, including utilization of health care services. Yet these associations are not uniform and can differ when various population subgroups are compared. As such, a growing body of scientific work argues for the need to apply an intersectional lens to the study of gender and health, and this work details how various cross-cutting identities (e.g., age, racial/ethnicity identity, social class, sexual orientation) intersect with gender to shape health outcomes. More recently, scholars have begun to assess how non-binary measures of gender identity relate to health status, and thus a small but increasing body of research explores whether and how health status varies for cisgender and transgender adults. While a substantial amount of attention has been given to describing the nuances of how gender relates to health status, the gender-health literature is also characterized by robust discussion of the factors that contribute to gender patterns in health status, including but not limited to socioeconomic status, relationships and care work, differential experiences in medical care treatment, masculinity, stress and social supports, and health behaviors.

Therefore, she needs a fiduciary to carry out that action, who does not necessarily have an interest in carrying it out to the satisfaction of the beneficiary. Since this is a problematic and potentially dangerous relationship for the beneficiary, both in private law and in democratic political relations, the fiduciary must be held accountable. That is why contemporary economics, law, bioethics and political philosophy have dealt with fiduciary relationships.

It argues that at the start of the century, animals were regarded most often as resources. Moreover, we drew a distinct boundary between humans and other animals. By the end of the century, our attitudes toward animals had changed, and we began to question the subordination implicit in the human–animal boundary. Franklin highlights companionship with animals, hunting and fishing, the meat industry, and leisure activities involving animals, such as bird watching and wildlife parks. He emphasizes variations by gender, class, ethnicity, and nation.Leslie Irvine, <jats:italic>If You Tame Me: Understanding our Connection with Animals</jats:italic> (Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 2004).This book examines our relationships with dogs and cats, arguing that animals have a sense of self. Drawing on research conducted at an animal shelter, in dog parks, and in interviews and observation, the author argues that animals become such important parts of our lives because of the subjective experience they bring to the relationship. Challenging the view that we simply anthropomorphize animals, Irvine offers a model of animal selfhood that explains what makes relationships with animals possible. Offering an alternative to George Herbert Mead's perspective on the self, Irvine argues that interaction with animals reveals complex subjectivity, emotionality, agency, and memory.Linda Kalof and Amy Fitzgerald, <jats:italic>The Animals Reader: The Essential Classic and Contemporary Writings</jats:italic> (New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007).This edited volume is notable for its diversity in perspectives. It includes readings on ethics, philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, environmental studies, history, and anthropology. It examines questions ranging from ‘what is an animal?’ to those surrounding the ethics of cloning. Part I examines animals as philosophical subjects. Part II includes essays that suggest that animals are reflexive thinkers. Part III considers the various roles of animals as domesticates, ‘pets’, and food. The chapters in Part IV focus on animals in sport and spectacle. Part V focuses on animals as symbols. Part VI examines animals as scientific objects. Each chapter offers an introduction and list of further readings.David Nibert, <jats:italic>Animal Rights/Human Rights: Entanglements of Oppression and Liberation</jats:italic> (Lanham MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2002).David Nibert connects oppression based on species, gender, ethnicity, and social class to the institution of capitalism. By modifying Donald Noel's theory of ethnic stratification, Nibert explains the oppression of non‐human animals in all forms, from meat eating to vivisection. He then argues that the systematic oppression of animals led to the oppression of other humans.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Online materials</jats:title> <jats:bold>Animals and Society Section of the American Sociological Association</jats:bold>  <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""http://www2.asanet.org/sectionanimals/"">http://www2.asanet.org/sectionanimals/</jats:ext-link> This website offers membership information specifically for sociologists interested in human–animal studies.

If it were ‘natural’ and necessary to consume animals, we would not need advertising campaigns designed to encourage us to do so. The ‘animal industrial complex’ depends on a steady supply of consumers. Vegetarians and vegans are very threatening to the status quo.

Philosophical sociology is also an invitation to reflect on the role of the normative in social life by looking at it sociologically and philosophically at the same: <jats:italic>normative</jats:italic> self‐reflection is a fundamental aspect of sociology's <jats:italic>scientific</jats:italic> tasks because key sociological questions are, in the last instance, also philosophical ones. For the normative to emerge, we need to move away from the reductionism of hedonistic, essentialist or cynical conceptions of human nature and be able to grasp the conceptions of the good life, justice, democracy or freedom whose normative contents depend on more or less articulated conceptions of our shared humanity. The idea of philosophical sociology is then sustained on three main pillars and I use them to structure this article: (1) a revalorization of the relationships between sociology and philosophy; (2) a universalistic principle of humanity that works as a major regulative idea of sociological research, and; (3) an argument on the social (immanent) and pre‐social (transcendental) sources of the normative in social life. As invitations to embrace posthuman cyborgs, non‐human actants and material cultures proliferate, philosophical sociology offers the reminder that we still have to understand more fully who are the human beings that populate the social world.",sociology
10.1177/14687950122232530,"The cause of German anti-Semitism should not be sought at the level of individual attitudes but, firstly, in the context of German history and social development, and, secondly, in the changing social position of the Jews within that setting. During the Middle Ages, when the estates and guild-orders prevailed, there were severe tensions between Christians and Jews. These began to be moderated with the development of capitalism, as members of the Christian middle class became involved in a struggle to end traditional restrictions. In that context, independently of their attitudes towards them, emancipation of the Jews appeared to middle-class Christians as a precondition for the emergence of Jews as good German citizens, and Jewish merchants and bankers became welcome allies in economic expansion. However, once the struggle of the middle classes against the nobility had been won, the Christian sections of the newly dominant ruling class underwent a political u-turn; hostility against the Jews, who had become a middle class of second rank, increased. It increased still further with the loss of the First World War and the crises that followed it, especially among the most economically constricted strata. In that situation, the Jews were socially conspicuous but relatively powerless. They had few resources for struggling effectively against what had become, for them, a crippling social order. Better to fight for a home in Palestine, or at least to accustom themselves to behaving in a self-aware but unobtrusive way. [Translators' text.]",sociology
10.1177/1440783312458226,"Sociology once debated ‘the social’ and did so with a public readership. Even as late as the Second World War, sociologists commanded a wide public on questions about the nature of society, altruism and the direction of social evolution. As a result of several waves of professionalization, however, these issues have vanished from academic sociology and from the public writings of sociologists. From the 1960s onwards sociologists instead wrote for the public by supporting social movements. Discussion within sociology became constrained both by ‘professional’ expectations and political taboos. Yet the original motivating concerns of sociology and its public, such as the compatibility of socialism and Darwinism, the nature of society, and the process of social evolution, did not cease to be of public interest. With sociologists showing little interest in satisfying the demand, it was met by non-sociologists, with the result that sociology lost both its intellectual public, as distinct from affinity groups, and its claim on these topics.",sociology

These questions ask us to consider who our students are, how the course fits with university mission and program goals, what we want students to learn in this course and how we can build consensus about that common core, the extent to which there is alignment between learning objectives and our disciplinary standards in sociology, how assessment can be used to improve course design and curriculum in general, and the role that introductory sociology plays in recruitment and retention of students to the university and to the major.

10.1332/policypress/9781529211740.003.0002,"<p>A unifying theme in the chapters in this volume is that semiotics offers important analytic tools for understanding the creation and reproduction of contextual meaning in social life (see Introduction). Consistent with this theme, my research program has centered on the semiotic distinction between the socially marked and the socially unmarked. I have employed these sensitizing analytic concepts to examine a range of issues, including sexual identity (Brekhus, 1996), theoretical attention in sociology (Brekhus, 1998, 2000), cognition (Brekhus, 2015; Brekhus and Ignatow, 2019), risk (Brekhus, 2018), and identity (Brekhus, 2020). Broadly speaking, I focus on identity, difference, cognition, and representation, with a particular interest in the ways that intersecting dimensions of markedness and unmarkedness shape cultural perception, worldviews, cognition, and the reproduction of social inequalities. The semiotic distinction between the marked and the unmarked was first introduced in the 1930s by linguists Trubetzkoy and Jakobson (see Jakobson, 1972; Trubetzkoy and Jakobson, 1975: 162). Linguist Linda Waugh (1982), in her article “Marked and Unmarked: A Choice between Unequals in Semiotic Structure,” developed the marked/unmarked distinction into a broader semiotic framework featuring semiotic pairs such as blackness/whiteness and homosexuality/heterosexuality, across different semiotic systems (see also Zerubavel, 2018, p. 2). Following the lead of Waugh, who argued that the same logic of the actively accented (marked) and the passively unacknowledged (unmarked) that applied to linguistic contrasts also applies to social contrasts, I have helped to import these concepts into the social sciences. In my own work, inspired by Waugh’s analysis, I first applied a semiotic markedness/unmarkedness analysis to sexual identity construction in the US (Brekhus, 1996), wherein I noted that some sexual behaviors and identities are marked as “deviant” and given special labels, while others remain unmarked, unaccented, and even unlabeled.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0210,"<p>The sociological study of authority (i.e., legitimate workplace control of human and organizational resources) is rooted in early theoretical debates surrounding the conceptualization of stratification and social class position. Such debates around conceptualization naturally led to disagreements over the manner in which authority should be measured (qualitative categories versus quantitative scales) for empirical assessment of social inequality. Thus, this field of sociological inquiry is about measuring positions in the workplace, the processes leading to those positions, and the consequences of those positions for workplace rewards. In addition to theory and measurement, the emergence of authority research includes studies of gender, race, and ethnic differences in the factors that determine authority and in the consequences of authority for various workplace outcomes. As multiracial/ethnic samples became available, researchers focused on the manner in which gender intersected with race/ethnicity to forge differential authority outcomes for men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Studies here underscore the fact that job authority remains unevenly distributed nationally (race/ethnicity, gender), and cross-nationally (gender), and authority gaps have remained robust over time. Authority studies employ a variety of data from the United States and Europe, regions that dominate quantitative assessments of authority inequality, but recent data from Israel and Korea foreshadow the extension of these inquiries to less traditional locales, thereby expanding our understanding of group differences and similarities in authority attainment more globally.</p>",sociology

Contributions from the field include theoretical frameworks to address how children and youth learn about race and racism, form racial identities and racial attitudes, and understand themselves and others as racial subjects. Additionally, sociological research offers a wealth of empirical evidence concerning how children and youth experience, navigate, reinforce, and/or challenge racial inequality, racism, and racial discrimination in their everyday lives. This work examines the role that social structures, systems, and institutions—such as families, schools, the state, health-care systems, the economic system, and the media—play in shaping young people’s lived experiences, opportunities, and outcomes. Sociological research also explores the process of the racialization of youth, the consequences of these racialized understandings, and how this leads to the continued dehumanization of children of color. Scholarship additionally examines the agency of young people and how they engage as political participants in the racialized society in which they live as well as how youth participate in consumer culture in ways that connect to their own racial and ethnic identities. Sociologists in the current moment tend to pay particular attention to the establishment of child-centered methodologies and strategies for equitable and ethical approaches to the study of youth and race. As such, many of these citations highlight scholarly efforts to dismantle long-standing racist stereotypes and assumptions about young people of color and demonstrate the complex nature of race, racism, and racialization with respect to youth.</p>",sociology

We are introduced to structuralism as it exists in the world, its scope and definition and as a methodology for the social sciences. This is followed by the approach to structuralism as scientific theory, method and as philosophical world view. Finally discusses are the principles of structural analysis, structuralism in language, literature and culture, in social structure, with regard to society and the individual, religion, philosophy, politics, sociology and social-anthropology.</p>",sociology

It also discusses several propositions, such as the opposition on the professionalization of public sociology through its institutionalization as a sociological subgenre. The chapter talks about the approach to social media platforms as digital commons that enable participation inside and outside, and the recruitment of the figure of 'the public intellectual' that recasts social media as a less elitist and more sociable figure that speaks as much as they listen. It articulates a vision for thinking and doing things differently in ways that empower, instead of powering social media systems or academic institutions whose interests can and often do diverge from people.</p>",sociology

At the crux of this model is a site, the supermarket, that dramatizes nonhuman agency as a mundane yet complex fact of social experience—a fact that Latour theorizes throughout his writings and that a host of literary authors, above all Don DeLillo, have sought to explore in different ways. It offers a reading of the novel in terms of Actor-Network-Theory (ANT) and demonstrates how a site that is crucial to both the novelist and the sociologist can facilitate a new interdisciplinary conversation, a mode of inquiry that would divert from a more traditional sociology of literature whose objective would be to identify the deep significance of literary form in the social forces that subtend aesthetic production.</p>",sociology

Educational policies include those official and unofficial guidelines that are developed by policymakers, school administrators, and educators to influence the way that schools both directly and indirectly provide education to students. In the United States, these policies include a variety of state and federal laws and regulations that govern students’ pre-kindergarten, primary (K–8), and secondary schooling (high school), as well as policies affecting higher education (college and beyond). Scholars studying education show that examining how policies are created—who creates it and for what purpose—and also how the policy is put into practice at the state and district level is crucial for understanding inequalities. This entry focuses on K–12 educational policy and race in the United States. More specifically, the focus is primarily on influential policies in schools since the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision, with particular attention on two crucial types of race-based educational policy: desegregation and school choice programs. There are many other educational policies not addressed here that could be examined for their influence in racial schooling inequities. This piece focuses on K–12 educational policies, but policies related to race in pre-K as well as institutions of higher education are also areas in which educational policies are impacted by race relations. Examining those formal and informal guidelines for the way that they shape children’s schooling is crucial for understanding how racial inequalities persist within contemporary society. As a practice of power, education policy has the potential to be used as a tool for positive social change and disrupt white supremacy within the context of schooling. Yet doing so requires first recognizing the way that race and racism have been written into school policies.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0237,"<p>Although they developed distinct of one another, there is a growing trend to combine insights from the race, organizations, and movement literatures. In particular, scholars have called for a greater emphasis on incorporating race as a category of analysis within the organizations and movement literatures. Among those studying organizations, one of the earliest calls for this shift came from within the managerial literature. Those heeding this call have primarily investigated race as an individual level characteristic that structures people’s access to and opportunities within organizations. Still, others have sought to analyze how race as a social structural characteristic shapes organizational development and the distribution of resources available to organizations. Similar to organization studies, initially, scholarship on social movements lacked a clear emphasis on race. Although, the irony here is that many scholars derived theoretical innovations within the social movement literature by analyzing movements centering racial justice. Recent scholarship holds that in the absence of clear racial theory, whiteness shapes the discipline to its detriment. Despite the broader concerns about the literature’s state, work within this area consistently emphasizes how people use social movement tactics to advance racial projects from civil rights to white supremacy. Few studies tackle all three themes at once. More often scholars situate their analysis at the intersection of race and organizations or race and movements. At times, scholars situate their investigation squarely within one literature, leaving it to the reader to pull out the themes from the others. The bibliography reflects this reality and tension. There is no singular text or handbook that brings together research on race, organizations, and movements. Yet, the research included within this bibliography deepens our understanding of the role that organizations and movements play in reinforcing and creating racial hierarchy and how racial hierarchy, in turn, shapes these entities.</p>",sociology
10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0216,"<p>Ethnomethodology (literally people’s methodology) is the study of practices through which members of a society collectively organize and sustain their activities. As the term suggests, ethnomethodology treats methodology as a widespread social phenomenon in addition to being a specialized set of practices in a science or other professional undertaking. Consequently, for ethnomethodology, the development and practical use of methods is a topic of sociological investigation rather than an exclusive disciplinary resource. Harold Garfinkel (b. 1917–d. 2011) coined the term “ethnomethodology” and founded the field that goes by that name. He studied under Talcott Parsons (b. 1902–d. 1979), but radically transformed the structural-functionalist theory of action that Parsons developed in the 1930s and 1940s. Garfinkel’s distinctive empirical approach to social action and interaction drew upon Edmund Husserl’s (b. 1859–d. 1938) phenomenological analysis of the everyday life-world, which Alfred Schutz (b. 1899–d. 1959) developed for sociology. Garfinkel gave relatively little mention of the philosophy of ordinary language arising from the later philosophical work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (b. 1889–d. 1951), and developed in reference to the social sciences by Peter Winch (b. 1926–d. 1997), but others have drawn linkages between them. Ethnomethodological research describes the organization of situated activities, including commonsense reasoning and ordinary language use, as well as more specialized practices of playing music, solving mathematics problems, or performing scientific experiments. Although ethnomethodology initially developed as part of sociology, and is still recognized as a sociological subfield, it has made inroads into philosophy of social science, social anthropology, communication and information studies, education studies, and science and technology studies. The allied field of Conversation Analysis, founded by Harvey Sacks (1935–1975) and developed by his students and colleagues, has also made strong inroads into sociolinguistics and related areas of research on social interaction.</p>",sociology

In the legal sense, consumer credit only refers to unsecured debt (e.g., payday loans, credit card debt, car purchase loans, consumer loans); however, in the sociological literature, it is used more broadly to include also secured debt, such as home equity loans and mortgages. The social studies of consumer credit and debt draw on economic sociology, economic geography, political economy, organization theory, cultural sociology, and economic anthropology to examine the social, political, and cultural causes and consequences of indebtedness. The wider theoretical concern of this inquiry is not debt per se, but to understand how debt changes our answers to long-standing sociological questions relating to inequality, social relations, cultural change, power, and the connections between economy and society. This review starts with general-scope sociological (General Overviews) and social history (Social History of Credit and Debt) studies on debt, which explicate the broader sociological and cultural significance of widespread indebtedness. The review then covers the two main strands of the social study of credit and debt. The first focuses on the institutional causes of indebtedness, examining macropolitical and cultural shifts (Debt and Cultural Theory), economic policy and institutional differences across countries (Political Economy of Credit and Debt), meso-level, institutional processes (Making of Credit Markets: Institutions and Fields), and the development of credit products and credit scoring within financial institutions (Inside Financial Institutions: Banks and the Lending Process). The second angle focuses on borrowers, looking at the consequences of indebtedness on social inequalities (Credit, Debt, and Inequality); at the credit process—how households borrow, how it changes their everyday life, how they are affected by payment difficulties—unpacking the way debt impacts subjectivities, social relationships, and oppression through lived experiences (Borrowers and the Credit Process); and at opportunities for resistance (Debt Resistance, Financial Dissent, and the New Politics of Finance). This review does not include student debt and microfinance because they are technically not consumer credit; nor does it include mortgage-backed securities, which are not credit products in themselves, but credit derivatives.</p>",sociology

10.1177/00113921241292454,"This Current Sociology Monograph draws together six articles that broker novel concepts into economic sociology. To orient this enterprise, this article examines the concepts of creativity and novelty in social theory and explains why it is challenging work to broker concepts across intellectual communities. To understand the existing boundaries across which one could broker, it next describes how the subfield of economic sociology has been shaped by the separation of economics and sociology as distinct fields, which ultimately led to a decline of sociologists studying the economy. Two counter-acting organizational forces that sought to institutionalize a subfield of economic sociology was the formation in the mid-1970s of the International Sociological Association’s Research Committee on Economy and Society (ISA RC02), and the institutionalization in the mid-1980s of the New Economic Sociology. The latter became a global brand exported from the United States that eclipsed the former. The New Economic Sociology, a community of scholars primarily based in and focused on the United States and typically indifferent (if not skeptical) to neo-Marxist approaches and international political economy, became globally associated with what constitutes economic sociology (and what is not). Consequently, it would be beneficial to broker in concepts to economic sociology beyond the historic limitations of the New Economic Sociology.",sociology

To do sociological studies of human rights in locations where both discipline and topic are contested, therefore, necessitates a sophisticated treatment of the relation between them if trustworthy results are to be generated.

More specifically, it explores the ramifications of the International Olympic Committee’s Host City Contract from 2024 onwards. This contract requires the event bidder to actively engage in the protection of human rights. But how can we explore ethnographically the execution of this requirement? Rather than resuming ideas on a ‘syncretised’ sociology as a response to the burdens of methodological nationalism and Eurocentrism, this article uses the IOC contract as an example and lessons from the Fédération de Internationale de Football Association’s (FIFA) work on human rights to argue that there is an unexplored potential in improving sociological ethnographic research by adapting it to the specifics of a topic.",sociology

Using automated text analysis for 8737 abstracts of articles published between 1995 and 2017, we discover evidence of this divide, but also of an entanglement between methodological choices and different research topics.

Sociologists are increasingly conceptualizing poverty, global economic inequality, and social inequalities of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation not as social problems, but rather as human rights abuses. The shift of emphasis from the social problems perspective to the human rights perspective demands a different set of remedies from IGOs, national governments, and local authorities. Whereas in the past sociologists tended either to recommend modifications to social policies or to propose large‐scale social transformation, they now find themselves advocating the implementation of human rights on the global, national, and local levels. This has brought sociologists into the area of global governance. The process of delineating an explicitly sociological perspective on human rights is impeded by two overlapping dilemmas: (1) the tension between an approach that emphasizes the analysis of ‘rights effects’ on the global, national, and local levels and an approach that stresses the advocacy of rights as a palliative for social inequalities; and (2) the tension between an interdisciplinary vision, in which sociology would join other disciplines in illuminating human rights and a unidisciplinary vision, in which sociologists and their allies would push for a unified social science founded on human rights.",sociology

Analysis of auto-ethnographic data on the production of a painting of Australian mallée woodland establishes three propositions for an anti-humanist sociology of creativity: that creative production is part of an open-ended flow of affect between assembled human and non-human elements; that affective flows produce creative capacities to act, feel and desire in bodies; and that products of creativity such as artworks are themselves affects that themselves contribute to the production of social life, the world and human history.",sociology

The formation of a ‘global sociology’ demands harmonious development and mutual enrichment between all the four ‘sociologies’, however, each of them has its own path in the global arena. The literature analysis demonstrates serious limitations in the global progression of ‘professional sociology’, while ‘policy sociology’ and ‘critical sociology’ also experience major difficulties. ‘Public sociology’, largely inspired by Burawoy, seems to be especially promising globally due to its key advantages: orientation towards non-academic audiences and a focus on the most acute social problems. However, currently this disciplinary practice has several fundamental constraints: marginality, radicalism, ideological bias and inherent conflict-orientation towards other ‘sociologies’.

In this article, I reflect on the state of languishing induced by lockdown, and the intensification of uncertainty in our everyday lives. I offer some biographical details of the early years of my career, which has largely been within a single institution, Maynooth University. The late Professor Liam Ryan was my boss and later my friend from 1990 until his death in 2015. His (typically) acerbic insights on the state of Irish sociology were recorded in 1984 for an issue of the Sociological Association of Ireland Bulletin. Re-visiting his prognosis today, I reflect on North–South relations in the discipline, on the challenge of forging a public role for Irish sociology, and on the growth of a precariat within the academic discipline.

Contradictory paradigms and lack of academic reputation marked the beginnings of German sociology. After World War I it had to defend itself against right-wing political mistrust. Therefore, many sociologists abstained from political comment and from empirical research as well. Beginning in 1925 there arose a new empirical orientation whose proponents were mostly on the right. Even for them, the take-over of the Nazis came as a total surprise. Jewish sociologists were forced to emigrate, leaving most others to accommodate to the new situation. Empirical social research flourished in the service of different political aims, while, with few exceptions, sociological theory disappeared or became insipid.

Yet ecology specifies that natural and social entities are bound together in complex interrelations. Why then does sociology insist on sifting out the social from the natural? The paper takes this question as its starting point and seeks to identify what environmental sociology might gain and lose from a shift towards ecological thinking. It does so by examining the case of actor-network theory, an approach that, in significant respects, closely approximates a kind of `ecological sociology'. Actor-network theory is `co-constructionist': it seeks to identify how relations and entities come into being together. Critics have focused on the problems of co-constructionism: they have argued that human actors generally possess powers of reflection (through language) and that these powers of reflection provide motive forces for action. Thus some form of social analysis is still necessary. Any ecological sociology will thus need to bring these two perspectives together so that humans and non-humans can be considered within the same frame of reference but so the distinctions that generally hold between the two can also be assessed.",sociology

This is because these books make the modern experience of European empires, colonialism, and, in many instances, incomplete decolonization central to sociology. They also question the discipline’s origin narratives and these narratives’ implications in colonial modernity. Thus, the books hold up a mirror reflecting back onto the discipline of sociology its own implication in European empires and colonization and demonstrate how sociology’s imperial episteme continues to shape the discipline today. This article reviews these books and focuses on how they engage in the double task of the deconstruction of sociology’s complicity in empire and the construction of a colonial critique-centered sociology.

The contrast is therefore between a well-known sociologist, one of the foremost scholars in economic sociology in the English language, and an economist of international renown who has challenged mainstream economics with his research on economic inequality and his call for participatory public involvement in economic decision-making. Both insist on the economic as social, but in distinctive ways. In this essay, first, I consider Granovetter’s long-awaited Society and Economy: Framework and Principles and Piketty’s recent Capital et idé ologie, a follow-up to his earlier, best-selling book, on their own terms. Second, I think through how each scholar might understand and critique the other, pointing to complementarities and important differences in their approaches. I conclude that although both Granovetter and Piketty challenge mainstream economistic accounts of economic life, while emphasizing human agency and so the contingency of given economic relationships, they differ significantly in their respective analytical and political-normative focus. For Granovetter, what matters is that economic life is a social fact, while for Piketty it is a social struggle.",sociology

Intensive sociological research on children has had a relatively short history, but in that time it has become an important contribution to the analysis of society. It has the capacity to serve as an x-ray or a magnifying glass, or just to provide an additional perspective in analysing social processes. It is clear from all the reports that sociological research and its social background are interdependent. Although childhood sociology has always been internationally oriented, there is a variety of themes and approaches and different emphases placed on particular topics in the different countries. Such differences can be traced back to the social definitions of childhood characterizing the respective societies. For almost all of the countries, however, there is only a weak connection between sociological research concerning children and the core domains of sociology.

This latter concept in turn was essential to clarifying the sociologists’ idea of the social or society. Peirce also created the modern theory of the dialogical self, which explained the symbolic character of human beings and proved foundational for social psychology. Politically Peirce was a right-wing conservative, but his ideas eventually contributed to the egalitarian views of cultures and sub-cultures. In addition his ideas contributed, by way of unanticipated consequences, to the 20th-century human rights revolutions in the American legal system.

First, the concept of reconciliation is interrogated as an instrument for sociological enquiry. The article locates the concept’s lexical origins in western/northern Christian traditions and identifies the usages of religious connotations in secularised strands of conflict resolution theory and praxis. While acknowledging the problems involved in assuming a conceptual universality, the basic meaning of the concept is located in many different historical, religious and secular traditions across the globe. Once overcoming Christiano-centric and western/northern biases and limitations, reconciliation can be retrieved and operationalised as a sociological concept for understanding and comparing ethnically and other deeply divided societies. Second, the article argues for further development of sociological comparative perspectives on how societies deal with violent and divisive past, which enhances academic knowledge and may impact policy as regards reconciliation processes, both in terms of understanding the past as well as dealing with the present and future of post-conflict societies. A sociology of conflict and reconciliation offers frames for transferring knowledge and experience that transcends simplistic assumptions and enriches understanding of the complexities of conflict and its transformations.",sociology

Within the framework of a ‘return to the actor’, marked by interpretative theories and symbolic interactionism, some sociologists of education played an important part in this rediscovery, paying attention to ‘pupilhood’ ( métier d’élève), and then to the métier d’enfant. The new status of the child in modernity was thus scrutinized within the framework of theories of individualism.

It also reflects the influence of the Marxist tradition in Australia, focusing mainly on the state as a countervailing force to markets. The upshot is that the market is both a constant point of reference in sociological research, but also a ‘black box’ beyond social inquiry.

Information on a series of variables was extracted after analyzing 118 articles that have focused on ‘social capital,’ written by Chinese sociologist and published between 2000 and 2011. The analysis results indicated an accelerated popularity of ‘social capital’ in Chinese sociological publications over this time period. In addition, the early adopters of ‘social capital’ among Chinese sociologists privileged the network domain but marginalized the social trust and civic participation domain of the concept, while recent years have witnessed a gradual embrace of the social trust and civic participation domains in Chinese sociologists’ writings.

Such an analysis of continuities and ruptures shows the theoretical convergences among Latin America as a region and the political dynamics of specific historical processes. I highlight how the conceptions of 21st-century Ecuadorian populism as a “passive revolution” or “authoritarian disfigurement of democracy” provide some theoretical tools for examining the historical process of Ecuadorian populism but ultimately fall short of critical analysis.

Within psychology, the condition has been seen as an individual pathology, and there has been little attempt to relate this to the wider cultural context. The argument of this article is that shyness can be interpreted as both a privately felt state of mind and a publicly recognized social role. I revisit Mead’s conception of the self as an inner conversation between the ‘I’ and the ‘Me’, arguing that the shy actor perceives themselves as relatively unskilled in interaction by comparison to a ‘Competent Other’. It is then suggested that it is normal for people to drift into isolated episodes of shyness as primary deviance, but that in some cases the reactions of others can lead to a career of secondary deviance. However, while a display of shyness may be normalized in certain situations, in others it can pose a more serious or enduring threat to the residual rules of interaction.This motivates the non-shy majority to defend their normative assumptions by casting moral blame upon the individual, and reframes the ‘problem’ outside of society.",sociology

It is suggested that the sociology of health inequalities in Britain lacks an analysis of agency, and that such an analysis is crucial. A case is made that the recent critical realist contribution of Margaret Archer on ‘internal conversations’ lends itself to an understanding of agency that is salient here. The article develops her typology of internal conversations to present characterizations of the ‘focused autonomous reflexives’ whose mind-sets are causally efficacious for producing and reproducing inequalities, and the ‘dedicated meta-reflexives’ whose casts of mind might yet predispose them to mobilize resistance to inequalities.",sociology

In this study narratives are largely client-driven, being facilitated by clinicians' questions and concerns when needed. Narratives that most influence clients' decisionmaking and behavior are deliberately de-constructed and re-constructed through clinical exchanges, to make these narratives more effective and more dependable for clients. Advantages of using objectivity and research orientations in problem-solving throughout clinical exchanges are considered, as well as fact-finding strategies about families, religions or beliefs, social classes, cultures, and societies. Clinicians and clients are encouraged to discuss trends in histories, social systems, and cultures to de-construct false narratives and re-construct more realistic narratives. Best practice narratives guide substantive exchanges between clients and clinicians, and improve the quality of clinical outcomes during and after consultations.",sociology

This is premised on the idea that naïve experience of the social world dissimulates real relations of domination, which critique then reveals. At other times, Bourdieu engages in what I call the historicist mode of critique, which denaturalizes the doxic experience of the social order by demonstrating its arbitrary character. Whereas realist critique claims that the social world really is other than it appears, historicist critique suggests that it could be otherwise. This tension between the two modes of critique is not unique to Bourdieu, but also present in the Polanyian literature and in the Western Marxist tradition. By distinguishing between the two modes of critique, my aim is to clarify an oft-implicit division that cuts across different critical traditions in the social sciences.",sociology

It unearths intersections between Adorno’s literary-critical writings on Beckett, on the one hand, and his sociological investigations of contemporary social life and methodological writings on nineteenth- and twentieth-century social science, on the other. The article demonstrates how Adorno’s sociological and methodological thought informed his reading of Beckett and how his engagement with Beckett helped him deepen his critical inquiries into capitalist society. Adorno deciphers Beckett’s dramas as expressions of a damaged individual existence and as articulations of underlying social conditions: their functional exchange context, the mechanism of social reproduction, reification, and estrangement. These diagnoses of injured individual and social life draw attention to Beckett’s problematization of death. Adorno’s comments on death in Beckett elucidate an important connection between the emancipatory dimensions of his Beckett interpretation and his sociology.",sociology

This understanding highlights the interdependence between relational, cultural and structural aspects of home as a distinctive social experience. We then connect the sociological debate with the discourse on home across social sciences more broadly, with a particular emphasis on the heuristics, practices and multiscalarity of home. In terms of practical research, the methodological bases of ‘home studies’ are still in development, also regarding the prospects of translating and comparing home across socio-cultural and spatial contexts.

The religious sense produced by the lower strata of the urban populace in contexts of subjugation in urbanization and globalization is complex and depends on several factors. In order to analyse it, sociology must abandon its rationalist and erudite background to move forward to new paradigms that allow us to understand how it is that contemporary popular religion - including seemingly more primitive religious expressions - pertains to modernity and is able to be understood as part of the dialectic of current globalization.

This contribution examines if sport sociology is able to serve the praxis in this expected manner and which functions sport sociology is able to accomplish over and above those problems which are directly related to the praxis functions which at the same time can serve as a justification.  This contribution shows that the idea, that science has to directly serve the praxis, is based on a false concept of science.

Problems, which result from the relationship of science to other social spheres of existence that need scientific knowledge which result from these facts will be examined in detail. requirements.

Acting as a key agent of social transformations, acutely feeling, accepting and subsequently imple-menting innovations, student youth, having mastered new technologies and broad-casting them to society, accumulates the experience of both previous generations and contemporaries. The data of a survey of 9751 students of higher education institu-tions of the Russian Federation, who are citizens of the Russian Federation are ana-lyzed in the article. All the Federal districts of the Russian Federation are represented in the general population of respondents. The data obtained allow us to conclude that folk culture is largely preserved and transmitted by the older generation. Although young people, for the most part, realize the value of folk culture as a whole, they rank its elements according to the degree of their compliance with the needs of modernity. Two groups of approximately equal size were distinguished. The first group is «iden-tification». It shares the position that if a modern person feels that he belongs to a certain ethnic group and is interested in preserving its traditions, he or she must know the folk culture well. The second group stands for «cultural diversity», which means that a modern person should know his or her folk culture well, but it is also important to navigate the cultural heritage of other peoples. Based on the results of the study, the conclusion about the need for a constant intergenerational dialogue for the preservation, transmission and reproduction of folk culture, which is the fundamental basis of the national mentality and the stability of society is made.",sociology

The article divides the field in works that study media inwards – along the threefold dimensions of production and technologies, communication and discourse, reception and effects – and works that study media outwards. We argue that this latter perspective, examining broader theoretical, methodological, and substantive social implications of mass‐mediated communication, is the most promising one for a mature field of American media sociology. On this basis, we conclude with some suggestions regarding possible new, and as of yet understudied, lines of inquiry for future media sociologists.",sociology

After a short overview of architectural sociology and its history, the article outlines a sociological theory which sees architecture and related practices as a constitutive ‘mode of collective existence’. The article argues that architecture (in a broad sense) is not a mere ‘reflection’ or ‘mirror’ of society, but rather a constitutive and transformative medium of the imaginary institution of society (Castoriadis), its assemblages (Deleuze), as well as its subjects (Foucault). In other words, it claims that architecture is a material and symbolic ‘mode’ through which societies and individuals are constituted and transformed. As architecture is a cultural technique, which is primarily enacted in relation to bodies, perceptions and affects (rather than in a discursive, reflective way), the social effects of architecture can best be understood and analysed through a comparative lens. Finally, therefore, the article unfolds a tableau of diverse architectural modes of collective existence, thus providing an overview of different socio-architectural constellations. Such a comparative and synchronical view of different societies allows for a sociology of architecture which analyses architectural transformations – both historical and contemporary.",sociology

This article focuses on four domains in which China’s experience compels us to rethink our theories: environmental ideology, political economy, civil society and environmental justice, and international environmental politics. In each domain, China’s institutions, discourses, and place in the world-system reframe major currents of thought in environmental sociology.

The first is that the criteria for defining a WR varies considerably from textbook to textbook; the second is that these WRs sections contain little or no sociology. These puzzles are resolved, however, once we understand that under the guise of promoting “diversity,” these sections are really affirming the universality of what has long been identified as a distinctively modern and very Western view of religion. The article concludes with some practical suggestions for improving the religion chapters in introductory textbooks. One such suggestion is that paying more attention to Native American “religion” would be a useful way of introducing students to the view that religion is a social construction that has no stable transhistorical and transcultural meaning.",sociology

It is an expression of existing social conditions, which determine how we perceive and control our physical selves, how we use our body as an expressive medium, how we handle our body and control it, how we make use of our bodies, and how we view our body. When we speak of our body as a social fact, we mean the following four elements:  a) the ""techniques of the body"", or in other words, the way motion (e.g., walking, running, jumping, swimming) is traditionally realized in a society;  b) ""expressive body movement"" such as posture, gesture, facial expressions and so on, which serve as symbolic forms of self-expression and of (non-verbal) communication; hence, as ""body language"";  c) ""body ethos"" or the attitude towards one's own body, which match person al and social identity;  d) controls of drive and need.  Every society recognizes, and also usually differentiates on a class and gen der-specific basis, a norm for each of these dimensions of the body which firmly establishes body techniques, expressive body movement, body ethos, and physical self-control. Such norms apply to all bodily movements and to the control of drives and needs; hence also to sports.  What is ""possible"" and ""not possible"" in sports, what is acceptable in bodily exertion, body control, posture, which presentation of the body is acceptable for men and women, for old and young, for members of the lower or the upper class, is defined by just such social norms and rules, that determine the body as a social fact.  These relationships should be examined in detail, if we wish to judge the significance of body sociology for the sociology of sports. For this, it is necessary:  1) to make clear the anthropological prerequisites of a sociology of the body,  2) to describe the already mentioned individual components of the body as a social fact to classify its socio-cultural, class and gender-specific differentiations and,  3) to treat the specific dependence-relationship of the body as a social fact upon social development.",sociology

It is based on an analysis of CNAA course documents for degrees in sociology and the social sciences, and undertaken with the aim of contributing to the current debate on the content of the undergraduate curriculum in sociology. The survey results suggest several trends in curricular policy: in particular an increasing emphasis on practical competence and familiarity with procedures and techniques, and a greater recognition of `methodological pluralism', although qualitative methods are still given only a marginal place in many courses. There was little evidence of progress in the teaching of quantitative skills, nor was computing yet seen to be a core element of the curriculum. The documents also revealed a continuing problem over the place of methods teaching as a whole in relation to other parts of the curriculum as reflected both in time allocation and in assessment weighting. It is argued that if the claims of sociology to practical and vocational relevance are to become genuine for students wishing to pursue research in a variety of careers, then research methods teaching needs to be brought out of the ghetto.

Central to the debate on sociology as a discipline and practice were efforts to document its history and paradigmatic shifts that characterized it, as well as topical themes that defined its research. One key observation in its evolution pointed to a historical shift from being a service discipline to the previous racially segregatory political regimes, especially between the early 1900s and 1960s, to a multi-paradigm discipline that challenged the racial order and inequalities in the 1970s onwards. This period marked the height of public sociology. Recent observations, however, especially in the post-apartheid period, projected a scenario of the discipline in a state of decline. Counter-evidence was nevertheless also presented suggesting not only the renewal of sociology in South Africa but also its active interest and involvement in the struggle against inequalities as part of the voices of the poor. This article calls these observations as the decline thesis and the renewal thesis, and contrasts them. The latter, I argue, is more compelling than the former. Notwithstanding this, the article argues however that the extent to which sociology in involved in struggles against inequalities is under question since public sociology, unlike in the 1970s and 1980s, is underdeveloped.",sociology

By distinguishing between good and bad, tasteful and tasteless, beautiful and ugly, taste classifies and orders the natural and social world. By taste one classifies oneself and is classified by others. Understood in this way, the sociological concept of taste shares many important features with its predecessor in classical philosophical aesthetics, the power of judgment. In this capacity, taste does not just refer either to individual preferences or dispositions (the term used by Bourdieu), or to some standards used in making choices in consumption. It is an important concept in bridging the gap between an individual's choices and his or her socially shared preferences or habits.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0211,"<p>Classification is fundamental to social life. It is the prerequisite to all other social activity. Before language, family, power, or organization, there must be rules for expressing sameness and difference, for defining what is or is not an instance of something, and there must be rules for how these distinctions are connected. Understanding space, time, or causal relationships, that something is an “independent” or “dependent variable” and that they are connected to each other, are social relationships that depend on classification; so, too, is the discovery of chance and the understanding of life in stochastic, probabilistic terms. Classification can be a simple distinction of kinds (this is an animal, that is not), but it is usually organized into systems of division and hierarchy, of more and less, better and worse. Kinship is about who and how we are connected to family or clan or tribe. Nationalism is about how someone is a citizen and the kinds of relationships that citizens and noncitizens have. Power is about who and when someone has the right to impose their will on others. And status is about social worth that is distributed based on race, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexual preferences, what people buy, who is beautiful, who is good at sports, and so on. Sociologists may take categories for granted, but some branches—those who study culture, politics, or race—are especially concerned with how classifications emerge, spread, or change over time. Changes in economic or political relationships often require a reclassification of worth or merit. And the terms that define categories are most often controlled by those who most benefit from them; however, efforts to resist power often involve challenging categories favoring the powerful.</p>",sociology

The sociology of religion is concerned with the multiplicity of ways in which religion is part of human society and thus it focuses on its institutional, cultural, and individual expression across varying social, geographical, and historical contexts. A common typology is to differentiate between substantive and functional approaches to studying religion. The former is concerned with the symbolic contents or meanings contained within a religious worldview and the latter with religion's purposes or functions in society. Following Weber's (1958) analysis of the doctrinal tenets of the Calvinist ethic, substantive approaches focus on delineating particular religious beliefs, defined in terms of concerns about transcendence and other‐worldly salvation, and how these beliefs are understood and give meaning to everyday life.",sociology

A large survey of sociology teachers revealed that they are required to teach outdated and sometimes discredited studies, which can reinforce rather than challenge stereotypes held by the privileged and which can be disempowering for those students who cannot recognise their own experiences. This article provides a unique insight into the ways that school/college curricula reinforce inequality and contributes to important debates within the sociology of education. Specifically, the article argues that the work being undertaken to decolonise the curriculum in universities, through challenging structural and discursive operations of power, should also inform the revision of school/college specifications. The lessons from this study can be usefully applied to the teaching of sociology beyond England and indeed to other subject disciplines.",sociology
10.1111/soc4.13176,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>This article is a review of global health literature, emphasizing the evolution in health terminology in recent decades and noteworthy research areas of global health. This review identifies global inequality and disease‐related stigma as key social determinants of health and central problems improving health outcomes. Within global health, there is a growing discourse surrounding health disparities, particularly among the world's most disadvantaged populations. Additionally, the field notes an increase in global health nonprofits, international governmental organizations (IGOs), and regulatory bodies. As such, this paper examines the scope of empirical global health research with consideration of inequality and stigma as well as the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in health outcomes for the developing world. The review also discusses the role of IGOs and global health regulatory bodies in shaping development and health outcomes. A broad review of literature finds that although chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are currently the largest cause of poor health in the world's most impoverished nations, these are largely untargeted by NGO efforts, which may exacerbate the state of global inequality. However, the impact that NGOs could have on ameliorating the effects of NCDs remains understudied and is a promising direction for future scholarly efforts.",sociology

Of central concern is whether the rural sociological enterprise, a potentially vital source of information and guidance on such diverse issues, will be able to effectively respond to such challenges. The author argues that in order to strengthen its relevance and viability in coming years, the rural sociological profession must embrace three important shifts. First, it must modify the manner in which it engages in the production of new knowledge by pursuing a more balanced portfolio of investments in disciplinary and transdisciplinary research. Second, it must take a bold step to build bridges to new entities whose missions, goals, and values closely align with those of the Rural Sociological Society. And third, it must take a more proactive role in generating quality, scientifically sound information that is aligned with the needs of federal and state policy communities, particularly information that can better articulate how policies are likely to impact rural people and places.",sociology

Seen from a French point of view, so-called ‘French theory’ appears as a typically Anglo-American category, along with ‘post-modernism’, while French debates among sociologists of art seem to have few echoes abroad.

Second, the author uses the example of sociology of work, her own field of research, to show how Latin American sociological production can and should make an important contribution to the mainstream debate in the area. Of this large body of work produced by sociologists of work in the region, the article discusses two examples: research on gender and work in Latin America, and more recent research on flexible production, showing how the findings and analysis of Latin American sociology of work are important in making concepts richer and more complex and in understanding many recent phenomena in developed countries.

10.1177/0038038514551089,"The article highlights two contrasting ways in which social theorists have been trying to define the ontological boundaries of sociology since the early days of the discipline. Some (e.g. Durkheim, Weber, and critical realists) have attempted to demarcate social reality as a causally autonomous and qualitatively distinct realm in a segmented/stratified universe. Others (e.g. Tarde, Spencer, Luhmann, sociobiologists, and actor-network theorists) have postulated a more open (or flat) ontological space and blurred such demarcations by either rejecting the causal autonomy of sociological phenomena, or their qualitative distinctiveness, or both. So far, there has been little convergence between these two orientations since according to the former, the opening of the boundaries is likely to give way to reductionist conceptions of society, whereas the latter tends to associate rigid boundaries with essentialism. Through a close examination of these opposing orientations, the article aims to shed light on current ontological dilemmas of sociology.",sociology

The aim of this article is to achieve that, while returning to the basic premise that sociology is the primary discipline that charts changes within the world-society. Two typical subjects for the sociology of globalization can be distinguished: defining what is ‘global’ at first sight and the identification of similar changes in (almost) all countries. However, can national-born concepts help to explain these subjects? This is debated by considering the sociology of social movements (Touraine) and the sociology of the elite (Aron and Rocher) to explain power in the study of alterglobalist movements.

As I claim, his overall work should be understood as a life-long critical conversation with the classical modernization paradigm from a heterodox and peripheral point of view — reflecting the Holocaust experience of European modernity as well as the precarious construction of a modern society in Israel. As such, his oeuvre can be viewed as an alternative, neo-Weberian synthesis of classical sociology to mainstream sociology. To demonstrate this claim, I firstly reconstruct Eisenstadt’s heterodox theory of modernity, emphasizing the tensions, contradictions and paradoxes of global modernity. Secondly, I highlight the contours of his comparative-civilizational, multiple modernities approach that has materialized in numerous path-breaking analyses of several civilizations — not only of Western but particularly of non-Western civilizational complexes. Thirdly, I emphasize the innovative research direction of his civilizational analysis for the new field of world history. Fourthly, I show also his innovative research direction in the recently growing area of the sociology of globalization and world society.

However, we are somewhat reluctant to interpret this as a kind of Irish Sonderweg or Irish exceptionalism. What remains noticeable though is a relatively late willingness to connect to the outside world – culturally and intellectually. This is partly explained by several decades of Catholic institutional dominance. The challenges since late secularisation of the field occurred in the 1970s have included epistemological dominance of the rather narrow posivitist type. Within this context university-based sociologists and sociologies have often been perceived as self-marginalised figures and paradigms. As we approach the new millennium the situation of sociology as a discipline is less precarious compared to earlier times. However, new institutional challenges, such as the metrics increasingly used to evaluate scholarship, have called more traditional notions of the discipline into question.",sociology

Another focuses on the meaning of urban and rural areas in people's lives. This paper argues for a fusion between these two views. Urban and rural sociology should be concerned with the relations between political economy on the one hand and the biological and psychological bases of human behaviour on the other. Recent developments in the human sciences and psychology assist in making this link. They can be used to extend the original insights of the early Chicago School of sociology, particularly as regards the formation of human identities. Nevertheless, there remain substantial arguments as to how `the Chicago School's biotic level' should be conceptualised and how we envisage its links to the more conscious, pre-planned, aspects of human behaviour. Early Marx and Williams's now somewhat neglected work on the country and the city offer provocative yet helpful ways forward.",sociology

Based on the so-called double periphery – the peripheral location of Argentine sociology in the western social sciences, but also of cultural research within local sociology – the author seeks to analyze the emergence of this subdiscipline. It owes to both the concern for mass culture and its relationship with populism at the end of the 1960s. At that time, these studies were being done by researchers with training in literary criticism, researchers who approached cultural phenomena as a political concern, in a way similar to what occurred when British cultural studies were born. At the end of Argentina’s last dictatorship (1976–1983), the reappearance and growth of a sociology of culture expanded into Nomadic terrains and into varied themes and institutions: this was due to a proliferation of studies in social communication and new university departments, but it can also be attributed to the influence of Brazilian anthropology. Another factor is the delayed creation of graduate programs and their clearly multidisciplinary nature. Today the field is testing its potential while undergoing both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, it is essential to re-examine the field’s sociological aspects as it moves along this path.",sociology

Their intellectual project emphasized data collection, scientificity and social reform, closely modelled on sociology in the global metropole. Underneath was a mostly functionalist concept of ‘a society’ and a strong conviction that Australian society was a case of modernity. They succeeded in creating an empiricist science, which played a role in Australian reformism in the 1970s and 1980s, and reached a high point in the work of Jean Martin. However many younger sociologists were dissatisfied with the founders’ science and launched other knowledge projects in the following decades.

Both Weber and Schumpeter wrote voluminously on capitalism, as testified to by such giant works as Economy and Society (Weber, 1978c [1922]) and Business Cycles (Schumpeter, 1939). One can also discern a distinct development in their thought over time: from emphasizing the role of various voluntaristic elements (such as the spirit of capitalism and the spirit of entrepreneurship) to stressing the role of institutions. The puzzle that one can find in their writings is as follows. Weber and Schumpeter both argue that a vigorous and healthy capitalism requires certain economic and non-economic institutions, in addition to something else. An absence of this ‘something else’ may lead to capitalist petrification or collapse, according to both authors. The answers of Weber and Schumpeter to the above puzzle, it is shown in the article, is somewhat different in their early and in their later works.",sociology

These ‘paradigm wars’ reached something of a zenith around the time of the final opus of a key proponent, Alvin Gouldner, in 1979. An uneasy truce was then reached under new conditions of growing economic rationalism. While mainstream academic sociology plunged into the ‘coming crisis’ foretold by Gouldner, a number of its graduates continued to develop reflexive sociology, particularly in non-academic workplaces. Initially called - after Kuhn - the ‘new paradigm’ or ‘critical interpretivism’, it is now known by many names. Most common descriptors would be participatory or action research, action learning or socio systems-thinking. The approach has gradually achieved surprising critical mass in enormously diverse organizational, workplace and community settings worldwide. The article concludes by noting that many ‘new paradigm’ assumptions have begun to enter mainstream social research, which may be beginning to reengage with the action research field - originally the offspring of sociological thinking three decades earlier.",sociology

10.1177/1749975520922469,"When analyzing literary fiction, most cultural sociologists still accept the well-established boundaries between the literary and the sociological, thus leaving literature stripped of its aesthetic qualities. Instead, I propose a new approach that focuses on the process of meaning-making as it occurs within the interaction between the reader and the novel in a given socio-historical setting. This allows analysts to capture those aspects of understanding social experience which are usually ‘lost in translation’ between fictional and sociological genres. My major claims are that, first, when referring to social experience, both sociological and literary texts employ aesthetic devices to mediate understanding for the reader. Second, within the literary genre, the understanding of social experience relies much more on the emotional engagement of the reader through a reading process facilitated by these aesthetic devices. Third, to benefit methodologically and epistemologically from the lyrical understanding of social experience mediated by literature, cultural sociologists must be particularly sensitive to the subtlety and ambiguity of meanings mediated by the aesthetic. The methodological advantage gained is the analysis of deeper cultural meanings grounded in, yet also going beyond, an emotionally and existentially experienced social reality, which is intersubjectively shared and filtered by various groups of readers and cultural intermediaries. The epistemological advantage gained by overcoming the assumed inferiority of literature is that cultural sociological research unlocks a whole new area for understanding the meanings of social life, especially its non-discursive dimensions. The research model I propose for a new sociology of literature adopts the landscape of meaning concept developed by Isaac Reed in combination with the aesthetic structuralism of Czech linguist Jan Mukařovský. This model will be demonstrated through an interpretive analysis of the Czech novel Sestra (published in English as City Sister Silver) by Jáchym Topol.",sociology

Aron’s approach to the nature of political sociology is, it is argued, deeply influenced by the German — particularly Weberian — understanding of the social sciences as a hermeneutic enterprise concerned with meaning, and by Montesquieu’s analysis of regimes in terms of their (essential) nature, principles and the sources of their potential ‘corruption’. Aron’s analysis provides not only an account of totalitarian regimes in a late, developed stage, but also an analytical snapshot of Western pluralist democracies at the high point of ‘sociological liberalism’. The final section of the paper seeks to identify some differences between Aron’s account of democracy and that contained in contemporary debates on ‘governance’. The striking differences that emerge make Aron’s analysis relevant as an account of a high-tide mark of democracy grounded in a particular mix of party competition and compromise.",sociology
10.1177/0011392107070134,"The aim of this article is to discuss the relationship between economic sociology and economic policies. In the last few decades, economic sociology has made significant achievements in terms of theory and research, but its influence on policies has remained weak. While this was inevitable in earlier decades, when scholars had to concentrate most of their effort on defining the role and contribution of economic sociology, it has since become a constraint for the institutionalization and recognition of the discipline. The return to economic sociology, since the 1980s, has brought about important theoretical achievements, especially in the analysis of economic organization at the micro level in terms of social and cultural embeddedness. The role of social relations in contemporary economy has clearly emerged, but its implications for policies to promote economic development have remained more latent so far. Although a weaker institutionalization and a poorer connection to policy-making certainly affect the political influence of economic sociology in comparison to economics, the article focuses on the research perspective. A shift of the research focus from the statics to the dynamics of economic organization could be useful. In this framework, particular attention is drawn to the study of local development and innovation through a closer relationship of economic sociology with comparative political economy. A separation between these two approaches does not favour a full exploitation of the potential contribution of economic sociology to policies.",sociology
10.1177/00113921221090253,"This article asks whether we need a posthumanist sociology, arguing that such a perspective can export a good deal of useful methodological and theoretical insight into the sociological toolbox. A posthumanist sociology is not a flattened ontology, in which we find agency in all things living and non-living. A posthumanist sociology asks instead what we do with the fundamental question of becoming both more and less human, following a surge of interest in decentring human exceptionalism. Moreover, a posthumanist sociology returns to the question of what it means to be an intersectional being, to proliferate the involvement of entities at the intersections of histories and social structures. Thus, it is a perspective that emerges from within the conditions of related crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has highlighted the need to decentre human exceptionalism, raising a challenge for sociologists to return to the premises of what it means to be a social being. In some sense, management of the pandemic already assumes a decentring. This article builds an argument by first reviewing what broadly constitutes a ‘posthumanist’ sociological perspective, then moves on to a case study of the interrelated human and non-human actors that constituted the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The case study usefully marks the intersection between human and non-human bodies as nodes in the interpretive production chain of this global event – one that acknowledges human extensions and connections to multispecies and ecological systems. Such interlinkages become foundational to interrogating what it means to become human in a posthuman world. The article ends on this posthuman question: under the posthuman condition, if we do not discern a difference between the human and other-than-human entities, how will this homogenization affect the human collective ability to enact and maintain cross-species and cross-entity protections?",sociology

Themes of uneven development, social and economic restructuring and internal colonialism were explored. The nature of Welsh identity was problematised.

I address four interrelated dimensions of loss that climate change presents: the materiality of loss; the politics of loss; knowledge of loss; and practices of loss. Unlike “sustainability”—the more dominant framing in the social sciences of climate change—the sociology of loss examines what does, will, or must disappear rather than what can or should be sustained.

The article then presents two case studies of research areas that have always been central to family studies – reproduction and household labor – to review how changes in family structure impact core family processes and alter the approaches for studying them. The advent of assisted reproductive technologies and the range of living arrangements in which the division of household labor now occurs challenge the parameters of the ‘traditional’ family.

This article examines Berger’s original application of a constructionist sociology of knowledge perspective to the sociology of religion and its application to the theory of secularisation. The article assesses the influence of this work – The Sacred Canopy in particular – through an analysis of publication data and a typification of types of reference. Although the metaphor of the ‘sacred canopy’ and Berger’s ideas regarding secularisation have been undoubtedly influential, his work never engendered a genuinely constructionist sociology of religion. The reason for this, the article argues, is Berger’s inconsistent application of his own constructionist ideas to his work on religion.",sociology

The orthodoxy highlights the open‐endedness of intimate relations at the expense of the family as an institution; that is, reflexivity over and above convention. This article argues that the new orthodoxy not only overstates reflexivity at the expense of convention, but abdicates understanding to frameworks grounded in biologistic and economistic understandings of human behaviour. The article makes its point through attention to three areas of research at odds with the new orthodoxy: paternity uncertainty, inheritance and family business. It then proposes that conceptualization of the family as an institutional regime gives due weight to the reflexive reconfiguration of family relationships and practices on the one hand, and their institutional embeddedness on the other.",sociology

In his sociology, probably more than anywhere else, taste is a central theoretical concept of analysis. By distinguishing between good and bad, tasteful and tasteless, beautiful and ugly, taste classifies and orders the natural and social world. By taste one classifies oneself and is classified by others. Understood in this way, the sociological concept of taste shares many important features with its predecessor in classical philosophical aesthetics, the power of judgment. In this capacity, taste does not just refer to individual preferences, or dispositions (the term used by Bourdieu), or to some standards used in making choices in consumption. It is an important concept in bridging the gap between an individual's choices and his/her socially shared preferences or habits. In addition, it can refer to more or less automatic responses as well as to highly reflective acts of judgment, or to behavioral responses which share both these aspects at the same time.",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0253,"<p>The sociological study of gender and social movements is relatively new. Until the 1970s, scholarship on social movements largely neglected questions of feminism and gender, and the fields of gender and social movements consisted of separate literatures. As a result, the major theories of social movements failed to take into account the impact of gender on the emergence, nature, and outcomes of social movements. But as mass feminist activism flourished in the United States and around the globe, so too did scholarship on gender and social movements. The earliest work in this area focused on women’s movements, both feminist and antifeminist, and applied the concepts and perspectives of social movement theory without explicitly taking into consideration the impact of gender. These studies, along with research on men’s movements, brought gender to the attention of social movement scholars by acknowledging women’s participation in political protest and men’s political experiences in gender movements, which had been ignored by mainstream social movement theory. But this body of work failed to consider systematically the effects of gender on political activism. By the 1990s, a new wave of research began to reconceptualize the relationship between gender and social movements by attending not only to how gender affects social movement structures and processes, but how social movements, in turn, affect gender. Many social movements have targeted the structures, cultural practices, and interactional norms that sustain gender inequality. Further, movements that are not oriented specifically around gender issues are also shaped by gender as a central feature of social structure, culture, and everyday life. Scholarship at the intersection of the fields of gender and social movements has had a significant impact on the cultural turn in social movement research, as well as on mainstream theories of social movements. Examining social movements through a gender lens has advanced several areas of social movement inquiry: (1) collective identity and intersectionality, (2) collective action frames, (3) movement leadership and organizations, (4) political and cultural opportunity structures and constraints, (5) movement tactics and strategies, and (6) movement outcomes. The research in this subfield and, correspondingly, this article, focuses primarily—but not exclusively—on the United States. The literature on gender and social movements has exposed many underexplored dimensions of social activism and has been foundational for the development of intersectional approaches to social movements. There is still much to learn by applying an intersectional approach that considers how power structures such as race, class, gender, and nationality intersect and the implications for social movement processes.</p>",sociology

Ward, William Sumner, Franklin Giddings, Charles H.

The review is based on the study of programmatic statements, the character of references in sociological writings, and available biographical information on their authors. All of these help to locate Soviet sociology within the intellectual enterprise in general and to establish whether it is actually a counterpart of what is called “sociology” in the West, or a different branch of intellectual activity which for some reason uses its name. Most of the findings are derived from an analysis of Sotsiogicheskie lssledovania (Sociological Research), the only specifically sociological journal in the USSR, published since 1974. These findings are compared with parallel observations on representative samples of the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review. The conclusion is that Soviet sociology, although it uses some of the methods of Western sociology, is an activity of a different nature on the whole. It is a branch of social technology, a managerial science oriented towards the promotion of the goals and the increase of the ideological and administrative efficiency of the Soviet government.",sociology

Rather such critiques should be seen as a call to a community of scholars to re- examine or reassess work that may have seemed ""finished."" In view of the rela tively low esteem accorded to sport sociology (at least in the United States) it may be proper to emphasize that the problems discussed above are by no means limited to the area of sport sociology. Indeed, they are to be found in the most respectable literature of fields more in the ""mainstream"" of sociology (see Deutscher, 1973; Hirschi and Selvin, 1967). Hopefully, a continuing concern for better methodology among sport sociologists will help us to draw on the methodological wisdom of ""general sociology"" and other related fields without repeating the errors that have been made by scholars in those fields.  A number of recent papers and exchanges in this journal and elsewhere have marked an apparent growth of interest in methodological issues among sport socio logists (e.g., Loy and Seagrave, 1974; Albonico and Pfister-Binz, 1971; McPherson, 1975: Wohl, 1975). This trend, especially the emergence of exchanges and discus sions regarding the relative merit of different methodological approaches (cf. Wohl, 1975 and McPherson, 1975; Lenk and Lüschen, 1975), may be seen as a sign of maturation of sport sociology as a field of inquiry.

The growth of women in prison in the 2010s has outpaced the growth of male prisoners. Not only are women a growing prison population, they are also a unique prison population. Women prisoners, compared to their male counterparts, are more likely to have histories of abuse and neglect and have greater incidents of substance abuse and mental health concerns. Women prisoners are also more likely to be the primary caretakers of children under the age of eighteen. The incarceration of women, then, has a substantial impact not only on the women who experience it, but on their families. Women prisoners also pose a unique challenge for correctional officials. The US correctional system was developed for males and is staffed and run largely by men. As such, risk assessment tools and in-prison programming do not consider the special needs of women prisoners. However, when programming takes into consideration women’s unique pathways into crime, they are much more effective. This article considers, in turn, each of these issues, beginning with a historical understanding of women’s prisons. Next, we consider the role of gender in risk assessment tools and prison programming, and the special issues surrounding women in prison, including female sexuality and parenting in prison.

Thirty years later, it is estimated that around 36 million people are living with HIV, with 95 percent living in low‐ and middle‐income countries (UNAIDS, 2013). There is at present no cure for AIDS and no effective prophylactic vaccine for HIV, and the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In 1996 a successful treatment was developed, anti‐retro viral therapy (ART), which blocks HIV from entering the body's immune cells to effectively slow the progression from HIV to AIDS to death. As a result the number of AIDS deaths is declining with 1.6 million AIDS deaths in 2012, down from 2.3 million in 2005. Although ART lowers the viral load, it does not eradicate the virus in those infected, and the number of people living with HIV worldwide (HIV prevalence) is increasing. Furthermore, for every person who initiates treatment, between three and four more persons become infected. On a more positive note, since 1999, the year in which it is thought that the epidemic peaked globally, the number of new infections (HIV incidence) has fallen. The overall growth of the global epidemic appears to have stabilized with the annual number of new HIV infections steadily declining; although levels remain high with around 2.3 million new infections globally in 2012, a 33 percent decline from 3.4 million in 2001 (UNAIDS, 2013).",sociology

The basis of genetics is the observation that the biological constitution of all living things – plants, animals, fish, insects, bacteria, humans, etc. – is shaped by a chemical called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) found in the nuclear material of the cells from which they are all made. The various ways in which this chemical can be made up carry the instructions for the construction, articulation, and operation of cells. A gene is a segment of DNA that carries a particular set of instructions to perform a particular task in relation to cell assembly or functioning. The totality of genes found in an organism is called its genome. The human genome is made up of about 30,000 genes, whose instructions combine to produce the varied bodies recognizable as members of our species,

Thus, the sociologist of medicine aspires to contribute to the development of sociological knowledge using medicine as a social institution worthy of study in itself. In the pure versus applied dichotomy of the social sciences, the work of the sociologist of medicine represents the academic or pure pursuit of knowledge. The sociologist of medicine is most often positioned outside the medical setting, in contrast to the position of the medical sociologist working in collaboration with medical or health organizations. The dichotomy of sociology of medicine and sociology in medicine was formalized by Robert Straus in 1957, in an effort to identify the affiliations and activities of medical sociologists in the United States for creation of a communication network among this newly institutionalized professional group. The distinction is in part based on the structural position of the scholar, on where the basic professional affiliation of the scholar is held.

The theory particularly attempts an indigenous postulation to social interactions among Africans in general and the Yoruba in particular. Its concepts attempt to emphasise contextual values of social beings who would contribute to social survival and community integration and development. This theory postulates that among Africans in general and the Yoruba in particular, the need to associate or co-exist by internalising and rightly exhibiting socially approved values of community survival and development, is integral to local social structure, as failure to co-exist potentially endangers the community. A deviant who defaults in sociating values is deemed a bad person ( omoburuku), while the one who sociates is the good person ( omoluabi). This theoretical postulation contrasts western social science theories (especially sociological Structuralist (macro) and Social Action (micro) theories), which rather emphasise rationality and individualism (at varied levels depending on the theory). Western social science ethnocentrically depicts African communal and kin ways of life as primitive and antithetical to development. Western social science theories have remained dominant and hegemonic over the years while Akiwowo’s theory is largely unpopular even in Nigerian social science curricula in spite of its potential for providing contextual interpretations for indigenous ways of life that are still very much extant despite dominant western modernity.

It is also a potentially difficult topic for sociology because of the importance sociology attaches to culture and context. The sociology of science has emphasised the continuity between scientific expertise and more traditional forms of knowledge. Whilst this suggests an increasing ‘democratisation of expertise’ is desirable, it also risks erasing the idea of expertise itself. This might be particularly detrimental for sociology as it restricts the role of sociological inquiry to examining how expert status is attributed rather than understanding what expertise is. This paper describes these developments and contrasts them with other approaches in which expertise appears less important. It concludes by setting out a new approach to expertise that respects the role of culture in generating knowledge but, by stressing the importance of socialisation and experience, argues for a more nuanced conception of expertise as both real and unequally distributed.",sociology

Such diversity results from the double movement of disembeddedness and re-embeddedness caused by the spread of constantly emerging market opportunities, and by the importance held by the historically and culturally different selective processes of path dependency in the construction of the institutions of social regulation and of the socialized preferences of economic actors.

Although such a postcolonial sociology of race is a project that has yet to be fully realized, there are a number of existing sociological works that begin the journey and point us in the right direction.",sociology

Noted in considering the trajectory of the field was an early absence of the sociologist as partisan and the staking of positions that make clear “whose side we are on.” While the critical turn in the sociology of sport has grounded its calling more clearly, challenges remain for the field to be taken seriously, and a key to advancing this is to quicken the pace for sociological knowledge about sport to “filter down” to public knowledge and play a role in influencing policy changes that can help make sport a more equitable and humane place. In considering the future of the field, Donnelly notes the inherently practical value underlying sociological knowledge and calls for sociologists of sport to engage Piketty’s call for public engagement in a way that can make a difference in how people experience sport.",sociology

They look for plausible explanations of phenomena that strike them as important due to their objective prevalence in social life. This chapter outlines the social scientific tools for studying religion, gender, and sexuality. Drawing on a range of examples from sociology of religion it explores the significance of individuals’ dispositions on the one hand and opportunities they encounter in their everyday lives on the other. The overall argument emphasizes the need for more collaboration between social scientists and theologians, or religious studies scholars. It suggests that secular sociologists would do well to consider the possibility of change in gender relations within religious contexts, and religious scholars could learn from the sociological method of inquiry to understand better the structurally determined mechanisms which make the symbolic gender order so resistant to change.</p>",sociology

               ‘The status of sociology’ asks whether sociology can be scientific. Some forms of sociological research follow the models of the physical sciences, but there are some fundamental limits to such imitation. We need to appreciate the differences between the subject matter of the natural and the human sciences. People think and feel. They act as they do, not because they are bound to follow unvarying rules but because they have beliefs, values, interests, and intentions. For the sociologist there is always a further step to take. Our notion of explanation does not stop at identifying regular patterns in social action.",sociology

LGBT people may become parents via giving birth or by adopting or fostering children. Some LGBT people may use Assisted Reproductive Technologies as part of their journey to parenthood. Other LGBT people may become parents as part of a blended or stepfamily. Overall, research comparing LGBT-headed families with heterosexual and/or cisgender-headed families demonstrates broadly similar outcomes for children. A key point of difference pertains to experiences of discrimination, which can occur when LGBT parents (and their children) access reproductive services, when engaging with their families of origin, in schools, and in terms of broader societal attitudes. Other points of difference pertain to the division of household labor, views on parenting, and beliefs about the needs of children. In many respects, the research evidence suggests that, across these three areas, LGBT parents engage in practices that positively benefit their children.</p>",sociology

One of the grounding ideas of visual sociology is that “valid scientific insight in society can be acquired by observing, analyzing and theorizing its visual manifestations: behavior of people and material products of culture” (Pauwels 2010: 546). Visual sociology aims to normalize the use of visual imagery as a valid and relevant type of data for sociological research. Visual sociology allows for using mixed methods, where quantitative and qualitative ones show different aspects of the studied phenomenon. Some recent studies on modern media, such as YouTube, demonstrate that both quantitative and qualitative methods can be combined (Vergani &amp; Zuev 2011). One of the important postulates in sociological analyses is consideration of image as data, and not as an illustration or embellishment of a sociological argument. A single image, a sequence of images, and even a repository of images cannot serve as visual sociology arguments in themselves without analyzing them utilizing sociological theory (thereby also developing the theoretical tool). Visual sociological analysis can be also presented with no images at all. Radically speaking, visual sociology can even analyze non‐visual data, for example, when interviewing people on how they create, interpret, and circulate images. In this case visual sociologists analyze data related to the social world around images and not specific images themselves.",sociology

Arguably, this rehabilitation of consumption has overshot its mark and has led to an overly positive, complacent and celebratory rendering of consumption and to an overriding concern with the symbolic and communicative dimension of goods. Driven by the debates on globalization, political consumerism and the relation between consumption and citizenship, current work shows increased interest in the politics of consumption.

Recently, this literature has been challenged and supplemented by an emerging sociology of international criminal courts. In contrast to previous scholarship, this sociology has taken the social dynamics that drive the development of these institutions as its object. More than simply responding to the international transformations that led to the resurgence of international criminal courts in the 1990s, the emerging sociology of these institutions was predicated on an epistemological break with previous forms of social science that created scientific innovations in the form of original research tools.

The author endeavors to show that four difficulties can be successfully overcome. (1) The first is epistemological in nature. Human rights are often presented as legal norms. By relying on the Putman/Habermas debate, the author maintains that Sen’s epistemology is Putnamian, allowing us to treat human rights a system of values (rather than as a system of norms), thereby enabling the construction of a system of evaluation (the “goal rights system”) that is neither consequentialist nor deontological. This system is open to public deliberation and can thus take into account the systems of evaluation of participants (in addition to that of the observer). This epistemological basis serves to remove the other obstacles. (2) By defining the individual in terms of “capabilities”, Sen avoids a methodological individualism that would produce an under-socialized version of the individual. (3) He includes social, economic, and cultural rights in the list of human rights, whereas liberal philosophies tend to exclude these. (4) He allows for the thematization of the specific conversion factors that condition the transformation of formal rights into real freedoms (internormative culture, civilian legal intermediaries, access to resources and the capabilities to use them). Avoiding formalism, the capability approach is a valuable instrument for a critical sociology of human rights.",sociology

What are the characteristics of the theoretical environment, in which cultural sociology is operating? The article begins by reviewing the literature on interdisciplinarity. Many authors argue that interdisciplinarity is increasing or should be increasing, but the general consensus is that disciplinary isolation is the norm. From this perspective, the relationships between disciplines can be understood in terms of <jats:italic>trading zones</jats:italic>, in which fields in different disciplines have little in common, theoretically, or empirically. Interdisciplinary communication in ‘trading zones’ requires that participants laboriously construct a set of terms that permits them to exchange ideas. Alternatively, I propose that clusters of fields in different disciplines are linked by <jats:italic>free‐floating paradigms</jats:italic>. Participants in disciplines that share ‘free‐floating paradigms’ are able to communicate with one another more readily. The article presents evidence for the second interpretation, drawn from survey articles in disciplinary handbooks. Disciplines and fields in which the study of culture draws from the same pool of paradigms and models and shares a set of lines of inquiry with cultural sociology include traditional disciplines, such as anthropology, communication, geography, history and psychology, and interdisciplinary fields, such as cultural studies, communication, feminist theory, material culture, science studies, and visual culture. Interdisciplinary fields – particularly cultural studies – perform an important role in diffusing paradigms across disciplinary boundaries. Free‐floating paradigms are associated with the work of major theorists, such as Lévi‐Strauss, Barthes, Foucault, Bourdieu, Lyotard, Baudrillard, Clifford Geertz, Bruno Latour, Adorno, Gramsci, and Habermas.",sociology

From an interview study, the differentiation and limits of trust are analysed within different types of social relations. Trust is found to vary greatly in scope and mode influenced by the intersecting dimensions of relations, objects and situations. Furthermore, trust exists between an outer threshold of expected deceit and an inner threshold of confident reliance.

Sociologists working to illuminate the causes and contours of these inequities often center the role of family foodwork, or the multifaceted domestic labor that supports eating, including planning and preparing meals. Mounting sociological scholarship on foodwork considers how food's meanings are socially patterned to reflect broader social structures, ideologies and institutions that influence their manifestation and families' resources to enact them. Here, we present three core contributions from the sociology of foodwork that can advance essential transdisciplinary conversations around nutrition disparities as well as efforts to tackle these disparities. We lay out how (1) family foodwork is historically rooted in broader structures of capitalist exploitation and women's subordination, and today remains gendered through normative discourses equating “good” feeding with “good” mothering; (2) the moralization of foodwork is buttressed by an ideological context idealizing homecooked meals and lamenting foodwork's decline, and; (3) foodwork—and societal evaluations of it—are shaped and stratified by intersecting gendered, classed, and racial inequalities. After reviewing each contribution and its importance for addressing nutrition inequities, we conclude by advocating for a closer conversation across disciplines and highlighting important future directions for sociologists.",sociology

The `thick descriptions' Geertz proposes for social science are powerful reconstructions of the empirical, not simply detailed observations. Likewise, the local knowledge Geertz valorized is inevitably rooted in more encompassing, global meaning-structures, even while every global theme becomes not enriched but different as it emerges locally.

For a long time, the contribution of sociologists was in the vein of apologetics. They formulated functionalist explanations to show that new immigrants had to be pressured into assimilation. Homogenization of the increasingly variegated Jewish population was presented as a scientifically warranted goal, while groups who were not of ‘western’ origin and those defined as minority groups could be relegated to ‘otherness’ and ‘difference’. The self-presentation of Israel as ‘Jewish and democratic’ was supported by sociological theorizing about Israel as a ‘unique’ sociopolitical phenomenon. The patent theoretical and practical contradictions of the ideology tended to be explained away and for several decades of the state's existence, the official ideology was all but unchallenged.

In contradistinction to this standard view, which in current debates receives the name of methodological nationalism, I advance a re-interpretation of classical sociology's conceptualization of the nation-state that points towards what can be called the opacity of its position in modernity. Marx understood the historical elusiveness of the nation-state as he believed that it had already passed its heyday as political struggles were fought between Empires and the Commune. Weber captured the sociological equivocations that arose from the historical disjuncture between the nation and the state. And Durkheim, finally, tried to come to terms with the nation-state's normative ambiguity via the immanent tension between nationalism and cosmopolitanism.

Strong reflexivity, here illustrated through Standpoint Feminism and Bourdieusian sociology, permits a coherent delineation of the problem of the scholarly vocation, in a way that reconciles the social origins, efficacy and responsibility of science, and hence allows for a more realist reformulation of the cognitive, social and moral dilemmas we face as scholars, educators, and citizens.",sociology

Not having a clear anchor makes it hard to define what its critical component should be. Nonetheless, a rich yet disconnected tradition of sociology and critical political economy allows flexibility to reconsider communication and social relations in the broader societal dynamics of capitalism. Specifying a critical sociological approach to communication can help better define the role of communication at the micro, mezzo and macro levels of society. The multi-paradigmatic heritage of sociological theory can provide new ways of criticising communication power in contemporary society. Diverse contemporary developments in the critique of political economy give a breadth of understanding of the capitalist mode of production and its internal dynamics. Sociology can add depth to understanding social relations within and beyond the production, distribution and consumption process.

The main argument is that Simmel’s reworking of the Nietzschean themes of the will to power, distinction, and self-overcoming lays the ground for his vitalist ethics in The View of Life. An integrative reading across Simmel’s intellectual biography points to the relevance of the Nietzschean doctrine of eternal return for Simmel’s critique of abstract Kantian morality. The Nietzschean promise of life-affirmation is problematized in relation to the broader project of sociological metaphysics, which transgresses the boundaries between classical sociology and social philosophy. Opening up the grounds for a more sustained investigation into Simmel’s engagement with Nietzsche, this article resonates with contemporary discussions on the ethics of the relational self and sociological vitalism.",sociology

It then came under the influence of various trends, sometimes conflicting but nevertheless presenting a certain sociological and political unity. With the weakening of the demographic, territorial, economic, and political foundations of the French agricultural population, rural sociologists are now required to present a new analysis and a revised assessment of its position in French society. The object of this article is to promote better understanding of the reasons behind the blurring of images and representations associated with French agriculture. It invites readers to review and understand the different facets of an imagery that presents a paradox compared with the ideological constructs associated with the historical record of farming and the farming profession. Working in the tradition of the French school of rural sociology, we have set out to offer a sense of the social realities that now represent the main areas of analysis for French and European rural sociology.",sociology

As there is no doubt that only a substantial cultural change could counteract the trend, the article deals with that part of the western epistemic community that embodies the highest cultural capital, namely learned professions, by asking what theoretical and practical limits are they reaching? Are they accountable for the ongoing general situation? Are their knowledge, commitment and performance socially adequate? If not, do professional work, action and trustworthiness require new analytical, social and moral foundations? A plausible answer to these questions seems to be offered by the abandonment of traditionally dominant formal-rational methodology, a return to the concept of substantive rationality and the appraisal of the multidisciplinary advancements provided by sociology of science. In this respect, the analysis stresses the limits of dominant sociological approaches to professions, by centring on the notion of status-role and by enlightening the pivotal importance of the indeterminacy of knowledge as primary professional traits of professionalism. Consequently, it suggests the need for a radical theoretical revision of common views about sources, forms and degrees of socioprofessional reliability, trustworthiness and confidence, given the fact that such a revision is anyhow required in practice by the new trajectories of the profession power–knowledge nexus in the age of the risk–knowledge society.",sociology

I argue that such a structural lens is essential to our understanding of the meso (institutional and disciplinary) levels of teaching sociology. I argue a nascent ‘teaching and learning movement’ in Irish sociology may be emerging. A number of factors that have facilitated this are identified. However even a quick glance at Irish higher education also reveals contradictions and conflicts which threaten this movement before it is even established, including worsening staff-student ratios, increased casualisation of teaching and the neo-liberal turn. The paper concludes with a call for more sociologically informed work both on teaching and learning in Irish higher education, and on teaching sociology. This would enable more informed involvement in critical debates around teaching excellence at the national and institutional levels.

It is normative in the way that a lot of critical social theory (e.g., Foucauldian) is not and is not merely “deconstructive” but also a constructive engagement with the concerns of co-citizens. It, however, eschews the abstract, top-down universalism of Rawlsian liberal egalitarianism in favour of a context of national citizenship and pays particular attention to bottom-up political struggle. However, unlike some other activist-oriented perspectives or standpoints, it is neither antistate nor antinational but is guided by a sense of inclusive unity or the common good. Essential to this unity is “recognition” and institutional, not merely symbolic, accommodation of minorities and a perspective on the “multi” which goes beyond the black-white binary and a secularist exclusion of political claims-making by religious and ethnoreligious groups such as Muslims in western Europe. Critically, the Bristol School of Multiculturalism is not just normative in that it does normative sociology, but most importantly, it engages in political theory to justify its normative perspective against objections and rival normative positions.

The Qur'an has made man, society, and history sources of knowledge and has invited to the science of anthropology and the knowledge of human societies and history. A verse from the Qur'an is considered a universal sociological manifesto that refers only to the concept of change and its interconnected human-divine mechanism in the individual and human societies. Since the seventeenth century, the Qur'an has been considered in Europe and American Orientalist scientific circles as a useful work in sociology. After the Qur'an, Ali's first teachings are theoretical materials of social analysis that have analyzed and explained man in terms of behaviour and social relations. Farabi, the founder of Islamic sociology, Farabi's theory of urban and citizenship theory, presented the first classical analysis and explanation of the individual and society. He is the mine of sociology for all ages and all nations. His work Thoughts on the Case of the Good City is a secular work describing the individual and society and depicting the changes of the individual and society.

Abend distinguishes seven different meanings sociologists tend to impute to ‘theory’ and argues that no single definition can usefully capture these substantively different meanings. Counter to Abend, we propose and defend a minimal and versatile theory of theory, which does capture the important common denominators in sociologists' various uses of the term theory.

This paper develops an analysis of the ways objects of knowledge are translated into other media, in order to understand the visual practices of sociology and to point out unused possibilities. I argue that the discourse on visual sociology, by assuming that photographs are less objective than text, is based on an asymmetric media‐determinism and on a misleading notion of objectivity. Instead, I suggest to analyse media with the concept of translations. I introduce several kinds of translations, most centrally the distinction between tight and loose ones. I show that many sciences, such as biology, focus on tight translations, using a variety of media and manipulating both research objects and representations. Sociology, in contrast, uses both tight and loose translations, but uses the latter only for texts. For visuals, sociology restricts itself to what I call ‘the documentary’: focusing on mechanical recording technologies without manipulating either the object of research or the representation. I conclude by discussing three rare examples of what is largely excluded in sociology: visual loose translations, visual tight translations based on non‐mechanical recording technologies, and visual tight translations based on mechanical recording technologies that include the manipulation of both object and representation.",sociology

At work in the modernist portrayals of postmodernism as the external other of truth, clarity, and political responsibility, is the colonizing appropriation of the other as a fixed reality which is at once an other and yet entirely knowable. The ""clarity"" of Enlightenment hides the power play behind its assumed transparency. In contrast to modernist portrayals of postmodernity as a period in a unilinear progression, the latter needs to be understood as the other within modernity that cannot be reduced to the same. Postmodernism situates difference and alterity within the modem. To the extent that sociology is defined in terms of a modernist fundamentalism, it is poised to colonize. So is a critical sociology that assumes a marxist identity but limits the definition of that identity to an Enlightenment legacy. Postmodern criticisms are indispensable for a decolonized, ethically and politically responsible critical sociology.",sociology

This article positions the study of rights within a sociology of praxis. It starts from a premise that interpretation and realisation of international norms depends on actors’ social negotiation. We seek to contribute to the sociology of rights with insights from legal pluralism and to analyse human rights as a semi-autonomous field in a multiplicity of normative frameworks. Based on cumulative research into humanitarian aid in disaster response, refugee care and protracted crises, the article explores how humanitarian agencies evoke different normative frameworks to legitimate their presence and programmes. How aid is shaped through the ‘rights speak’ of aid workers and recipients alike is illuminated by cases of programmes promoting women’s rights against sexual abuse from Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",sociology

Increasingly, however, oceans are assuming a higher profile, emerging both as a new resource frontier, a medium for geopolitical rivalry and conflict, and a unique and threatened ecological hot spot. In this article, I propose a new sociological specialty area, the “sociology of oceans” to be situated at the interface between environmental sociology and traditional maritime studies. After reviewing existing sociological research on maritime topics and the consideration of (or lack of consideration) the sea by classic sociological theorists, I briefly discuss several contemporary sociological approaches to the ocean that have attracted some notice. In the final section of the paper, I make the case for a distinct sociology of oceans and briefly sketch what this might look like. One possible trajectory for creating a shared vision or common paradigm, I argue, is to draw on Deleuze and Guattari's dialectical theory of the smooth and the striated.Même s'il couvre 70% de la surface de la Terre, l'océan a été longtemps ignoré en sociologie ou traité comme une extension des systèmes terrestres.

Dans la dernière partie de l'article, j'insiste sur le besoin d'une sociologie distincte de l'océan et je présente brièvement à quoi cela pourrait ressembler.

Yet, it remains a semantically ambiguous polyseme that has been understood and operationalized in often divergent ways by sociologists. In this essay, we survey contemporary empirical research on cultural tastes and use retroductive reasoning from measurements of taste to clarify the semantic ambiguity surrounding taste. We argue that taste should be conceptualized as a person’s thick subjectivity in a cultural field, that is to say a fundamentally multidimensional orientation that describes how we feel, consume, and praise in cultural fields. Recognizing the inherent multidimensionality to taste allows us to refine our understanding of complex taste phenomena. We outline a family of complex tastes using characteristic antinomies among their constituent modalities of action, and use a case study to show how each variety corresponds to extant folk concepts about taste.",sociology

First, the sociology of aging encompasses investigations of aging as a process, of older adults as a group, and of old age as a distinctive stage of the life course. Second, aging research is performed at multiple levels of analysis, from macro‐level studies of age structure within and across societies, to meso‐level studies of labor‐force participation and family structure, to micro‐level investigations of health and well‐being. Third, aging research uses the full repertoire of methods that characterize the discipline, including life tables and other demographic methods, survey research, ethnographic methods, and observational studies.

The general heading of the sociology of work subsumes many topics, which can be separated roughly into individual‐level approaches and structural‐level approaches. Individual‐level approaches treat the individual as the unit of analysis and typically focus on ascribed characteristics such as gender, race, and age.

But over time, we realize that not only has no meaningful change been made, but that we are now no longer invited to the table for discussions. The polite responses always drown out the calls for change, or the offers of help are conditional, requiring us to conform to a white middleclass standard of social respectability that erases our very ways of being and the agency of choice.

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0220,"<p>One of the most pressing challenges of single-parent families is the concern for their socioeconomic well-being. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than two-parent families, and there is growing concern about the rising inequality among family types. Much research has focused on how children fare in single-parent families and whether or not they are at a disadvantage. However, concerns are not limited to children living in single-parent families, but also to single parents themselves. Single parenthood is strongly gendered: single parents are mostly mothers, and they therefore experience unequal opportunities and gender discrimination in the labor market. This bibliography addresses the key issues and debates related to single-parent families. Rather than promoting a single argument, it introduces the reader to a number of different perspectives, without taking a position on one perspective over the other. As the single-parent literature is broad and expanding rapidly, it is difficult to cover all aspects of single parenthood. Instead, this bibliography focuses on single-parent families in context. It covers how individual characteristics of single parents, such as their resources and education, shape aspects of their well-being. Yet the main focus is on how their well-being is also shaped by their socioeconomic and institutional context. How do employment and policy affect the lives of single parents and their children? The bibliography uses a comparative focus to examine the research on single-parent families across countries. Hence, it does not include all publications that address single parenthood, such as the social psychological aspects, but rather it examines the literature that best captures how single parents are doing in the context of the institutions and policies that surround them. This bibliography on “Single Parents in Context” is structured in six major sections. First, a broad overview of the literature is provided in the section on General Contributions This covers what can be considered Classics in the literature, and prior Research Overviews. The second section deals with aspects of the Socioeconomic Well-Being of single parents and their families, including Poverty, Child Well-Being, and Stigma. The next major sections (a substantial part of the bibliography) cover explanations for the often impaired well-being among single-parent families. These sections include resource-based, employment-based, and policy-based explanations. Resource-Based Explanations focus on individual characteristics of the single parents themselves, and include the debate regarding the important Diverging Destinies and Life-Course Perspective. Diverging Destinies suggests that single-parent families are increasingly common among those with lower socioeconomic resources, such as education. Life-Course Perspective discusses the dynamic process of single parenthood over the life course, such as transitions into and out of single parenthood. Employment-Based Explanations examine to what extent, and under which conditions, a job can be a means to improve single parents’ well-being. Employment is indeed important, because in some contexts single parents are employed but remain in poverty—considered the Working Poor. Additionally, single parents face particular challenges in terms of Work-Life Balance and negotiating the demands of work and family. Most importantly, this bibliography covers a wide range of policies and emphasizes various Policy-Based Explanations. Family Policy facilitates maternal employment and, increasingly, paternal care, as well as providing financial transfers to families with children. Active Labor Market Policy represents those policies that are often in the form of services, such as job placement and training. Such policy seeks to facilitate the employment of the inactive and unemployed. Redistributive Policy typically provides income transfers to help families financially sustain themselves. This is support from the social safety net in the form of cash assistance such as housing, food, and child benefit. Naturally, there is overlap between policy types, but family policy for families with children warrants a specific focus. There is also a focus on Child Support, which is a set of policies that regulates financial transfers among households of separated parents. This is followed by Policy Debates, a discussion that emphasizes the key debates around the design and implementation of policy for single-parent families. The final major section, Research Frontiers, lays out the frontiers in single-parent research. It highlights the potential major challenges and opportunities for research in years to come. These areas include Shared Parenting, Methodological Innovations, and Global Perspectives on what works for single parents and their families.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0257,"<p>Ethnic enclaves have been defined in numerous ways. The word “ethnic” is often used to refer to a particular group with a shared nationality or cultural background. Enclaves sometimes refer to the concentration of ethnic groups within a geographic area. Academic inquiry of ethnic enclaves began with Kenneth Wilson and Alejandro Portes’s study of the “immigrant enclave” formed by Cubans in Miami, which they define as a concentration of ethnic businesses employing people from the same ethnic group. Researchers have tested, expanded, and modified the “enclave hypothesis”—ethnic concentration having a protective effect against a generally hostile climate facing immigrants and ethnic minorities. Depending on the author an enclave may refer to the geographic concentration of migrants and coethnics in a neighborhood; a place with social and economic structures that diverge from those in the surrounding area; or a concentration of economic activity, particularly businesses owned and staffed by members of a single ethnic group. In the strictest sense, ethnic enclaves are made up of a high concentration of an ethnic group within a geographic space, including a large number of business owners from that community. There have been examples throughout US history of ethnic enclaves, including Cubans in Miami, New York’s Chinatown, Japanese and Korean enclaves in California, and Jewish communities in Manhattan. There are also immigrant enclaves across the world. The protective effects of enclaves are largely related to the concentration of economic power to support social, cultural, and political development for immigrant communities committed to sustaining community life within the country where an enclave is formed. Many researchers have used a partial definition of ethnic enclaves only in terms of residential concentration. From this point of view, the existing evidence shows mixed effects for living in an enclave depending on the context, aspects of the enclave studied, and relative outcomes of interest. When applied and compared, the similarities between enclaves and other community formations, such as barrios and ghettos, become relevant. Segregation most frequently serves dominant groups who use isolation to disproportionately apportion resources and exploit marginalized workers. Yet, as Cathy Yang Liu has shown, a concentration of opportunities can lead to strong social and cultural networks within ethnic enclaves. Researchers using the concept of ethnic enclaves can benefit from considering the multilayered factors of immigration, ethnic difference, urban environments, economic systems, health, and power differentials between and among residents in ethnic enclave communities and beyond.</p>",sociology

Like many of the social and human sciences it does not have a clearly defined subject matter. Sociology is a versatile and resilient discipline that takes many forms.

The name comes from Elias's use of the grounding concept of “figuration” as a deliberate attempt to bypass and reformulate the speech and thought parameters of what he saw as homo clausus (“closed person”) assumptions underlying much of sociology. Figurational sociologists reject such common notions as agency–structure, action–structure, or “individual” and “society,” all of which imply that “the individual” is something separate and isolated from “society.” They think instead in terms of figurations or complex webs of interdependent relationships between people (homines aperti, or “open people”). These complex webs of interdependence are always in a state of flux, hence the alternative title of “process sociology” preferred by many researchers working within this tradition.

It is an expression of the emotional and social manifestations of living between two countries and experiencing the loss of time with family and friends. It is an expression of the yearning for social connections that I left behind. It is also an attempt to reconcile with the experiences of forced migration and distance, which are not always successful.
 
I used to visit Kuwait annually, but when COVID-19 hit, it interrupted these frequent visits. Up until recently, I had not visited in four years. But I stayed connected with my family and friends virtually, though WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Zoom. When I finally went this winter, I was filled with overwhelming emotions. It had been too long, and I felt as though things have changed. But it was really me who has. Being away for such a long time has created a gap that I am still trying to understand. I was never troubled by distance. In fact, I loved it because it gave me the space to learn more about myself and explore the world. I thought I was okay with the distance for the longest time. But I learned how much I was craving the warmth of close connections, the in-person quality time, the long night chats, the morning coffees, the brunches by the beach, and the hugs I received from loved ones. I leaned that this distance meant missing out on making memories with loved ones. And losing so much time that can never be regained. 
 
I realized that when I was glued to my phone every day for hours, it was because I wanted to stay connected, and not be forgotten because distance can do that. I have already felt so many friendships fade away because of the distance, and now I find myself trying to hold on to those I have left. Yes, I made new ones virtually. And I had the chance to meet them in person this time. And it was beautiful. But now, I am leaving, again. I am more now of how this distance impacts me, and my relations. This time, I was very sad to leave. 
 
I wasn’t ready to leave just yet. I did not get enough time to be with my loved ones. It was a month, but it felt so short. I tried to squeeze all the meetings, squeeze all the love I craved, but it was so much love that just didn’t fit in such a short time.

10.25071/2563-3694.152,"This short reflection with a photo is based on an emotional moment I had during my last visit to Kuwait, where I was born a third-generation stateless person, and later emigrated from to Canada, where I currently reside. It is an expression of the emotional and social manifestations of living between two countries and experiencing the loss of time with family and friends. It is an expression of the yearning for social connections that I left behind. It is also an attempt to reconcile with the experiences of forced migration and distance, which are not always successful.
 
I used to visit Kuwait annually, but when COVID-19 hit, it interrupted these frequent visits. Up until recently, I had not visited in four years. But I stayed connected with my family and friends virtually, though WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Zoom. When I finally went this winter, I was filled with overwhelming emotions. It had been too long, and I felt as though things have changed. But it was really me who has. Being away for such a long time has created a gap that I am still trying to understand. I was never troubled by distance. In fact, I loved it because it gave me the space to learn more about myself and explore the world. I thought I was okay with the distance for the longest time. But I learned how much I was craving the warmth of close connections, the in-person quality time, the long night chats, the morning coffees, the brunches by the beach, and the hugs I received from loved ones. I leaned that this distance meant missing out on making memories with loved ones. And losing so much time that can never be regained. 
 
I realized that when I was glued to my phone every day for hours, it was because I wanted to stay connected, and not be forgotten because distance can do that. I have already felt so many friendships fade away because of the distance, and now I find myself trying to hold on to those I have left. Yes, I made new ones virtually. And I had the chance to meet them in person this time. And it was beautiful. But now, I am leaving, again. I am more now of how this distance impacts me, and my relations. This time, I was very sad to leave. 
 
I wasn’t ready to leave just yet. I did not get enough time to be with my loved ones. It was a month, but it felt so short. I tried to squeeze all the meetings, squeeze all the love I craved, but it was so much love that just didn’t fit in such a short time. I had to leave eventually, again, with a big part of my heart left behind. A big part of my life away from me. And no matter what I do to stay connected, it’s not the same.

Competition with the demands of housewifery means that to the mother as houseworker, the child is sometimes seen as an obstacle to job satisfaction; for the child, the need to juxtapose its demands with those of housework cannot but be experienced as frustrating. Although men do something to remedy this difficulty by involving themselves in child-care, the trend could be seen as a retrogressive one from the women's point of view. Ultimately, satisfaction with housework may be increased, but only at the expense of satisfaction with child-care.</p>",sociology

10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0058,"<p>Recent years have seen a rapid growth in interest in the addition of a spatial perspective, especially in the social and health sciences, and in part this growth has been driven by the ready availability of georeferenced or geospatial data, and the tools to analyze them: geographic information science (GIS), spatial analysis, and spatial statistics. Indeed, research on race/ethnic segregation and other forms of social stratification as well as research on human health and behavior problems, such as obesity, mental health, risk-taking behaviors, and crime, depend on the collection and analysis of individual- and contextual-level (geographic area) data across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Given all of these considerations, researchers are continuously developing new ways to harness and analyze geo-referenced data. Indeed, a prerequisite for spatial analysis is the availability of information on locations (i.e., places) and the attributes of those locations (e.g., poverty rates, educational attainment, religious participation, or disease prevalence). This Oxford Bibliographies article has two main parts. First, following a general overview of spatial concepts and spatial thinking in sociology, we introduce the field of spatial analysis focusing on easily available textbooks (introductory, handbooks, and advanced), journals, data, and online instructional resources. The second half of this article provides an explicit focus on spatial approaches within specific areas of sociological inquiry, including crime, demography, education, health, inequality, and religion. This section is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to indicate how some concepts, measures, data, and methods have been used by sociologists, criminologists, and demographers during their research. Throughout all sections we have attempted to introduce classic articles as well as contemporary studies. Spatial analysis is a general term to describe an array of statistical techniques that utilize locational information to better understand the pattern of observed attribute values and the processes that generated the observed pattern. The best-known early example of spatial analysis is John Snow’s 1854 cholera map of London, but the origins of spatial analysis can be traced back to France during the 1820s and 1830s and the period of morale statistique, specifically the work of Guerry, d’Angeville, Duplin, and Quetelet. The foundation for current spatial statistical analysis practice is built on methodological development in both statistics and ecology during the 1950s and quantitative geography during the 1960s and 1970s and it is a field that has been greatly enhanced by improvements in computer and information technologies relevant to the collection, and visualization and analysis of geographic or geospatial data. In the early 21st century, four main methodological approaches to spatial analysis can be identified in the literature: exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), spatial statistics, spatial econometrics, and geostatistics. The diversity of spatial-analytical methods available to researchers is wide and growing, which is also a function of the different types of analytical units and data types used in formal spatial analysis—specifically, point data (e.g., crime events, disease cases), line data (e.g., networks, routes), spatial continuous or field data (e.g., accessibility surfaces), and area or lattice data (e.g., unemployment and mortality rates). Applications of geospatial data and/or spatial analysis are increasingly found in sociological research, especially in studies of spatial inequality, residential segregation, demography, education, religion, neighborhoods and health, and criminology.</p>",sociology

It provides a comprehensive analysis of how socioeconomic status, race, gender, culture, and other social determinants influence health behaviors, access to healthcare, and the experience of illness. The chapter also explores key concepts such as the social construction of illness, medicalization, and the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. Through comparative analysis, it examines different healthcare systems worldwide, the impact of globalization, and the role of international organizations in shaping global health policies. The discussion extends to emerging trends and challenges in the field, including digital health, mental health, and global health inequities. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research and interdisciplinary collaboration in medical sociology to inform public health policies and promote equitable healthcare systems.

It indicates the intellectual influences of the early years that Bourdieu subsequently acknowledged and then examines his use of the work of Weber in his first book, Sociologie de l’Algérie (1958). The paper then focuses on the development of Bourdieu’s thought from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, a period in which he strategically presented himself as an anti-humanist sociologist whilst also articulating a view of science that was in tune with phenomenological and ontological philosophy. Bourdieu’s ‘Sociology and Philosophy in France since 1945’ (1967a) receives particular attention since his analysis of sociology and philosophy in France in the post-war period was a key element in his own position-taking in respect of the two disciplines. The paper then examines Bourdieu’s critiques of Weber at this time and suggests that his dissatisfaction with Weber’s epistemology logically became a dissastisfaction with the claims of sociological explanation as such. There followed an attempt to reconcile a commitment to social science with an allegiance to elements of phenomenological thought. The outcome was a willingness on Bourdieu’s part to see reflexivity as a means to problematiz- ing sociological explanation more than as a means to refining it or making it more sophisticated. The consequence was that commitments to phenomenological ontology and social science co-existed in this period. The balance was to change again subsequently in Bourdieu’s thought, and his responsivenesss to changing conditions exemplifies how we should ourselves rethink the relations between possible future social theories and the classical theories of Western sociology.",sociology

Upon closer examination, it is apparent that Durkheim and the Chicago school share a great deal more points of connection than are commonly acknowledged. These similarities have been blurred due to (1) a lack of distinction between the later, qualitatively focused Chicago school of sociology researchers with the more quantitatively-based work of the original school and (2) a pervasive misunderstanding of what Durkheim meant by treating a ‘social fact’ as a thing. A more accurate account reveals that the two research traditions are both heavily empirical, pragmatic, contextually based approaches to studying non-individualized, collective behavior.

Working under conditions of `inner exile' in Nazi Germany, Alfred Weber composed a series of writings dating from the years of the Second World War on conceptions of transcendence in Western civilization and their relevance to a sociological revaluation of the time-honoured claims of Judaeo-Christian monotheism. These writings compare closely with Karl Jaspers's existentialist conception of transcendence and `limit-experience' from the same period and also particularly with the later philosophical writings of Georg Simmel on the concept of life and the meaning of absolute value orientations from the standpoint of historical immanence. This distinctive conception of `immanent transcendence' — first named as such by Simmel and later reaffirmed by Alfred Weber — is explored in this article in relation to a range of questions about the normative import of theological figures of thought and language for the formation of modern social-scientific thinking and reasoning. The claim is defended that Alfred Weber's oeuvre should remain of interest to contemporary social theorists, despite its many weaknesses and frequent moments of obscurity.",sociology

While Aron has been largely neglected in the existing literature on neoliberalism, it will be argued that he was the key sociological figure to engage critically with neoliberalism in its formative years and, beyond this, that the value of his work today lies in its defence of the social basis of democracy and freedom against the raw economism of neoliberal thought.",sociology

In this regard, I am less interested in providing an overview of the different research streams of the main sociologists operating in the scientific and academic institutes located in Berlin than in reconstructing some crucial dynamics at work there and highlighting their effects at the social and symbolic levels. The underlying idea is that, especially in East Berlin, the sociological knowledge produced was less homogeneous than it has been represented in the existing literature. Without negating the existence of shared aspects characterizing Marxist-Leninist sociology, also superimposed on the political elite, a field analysis enables us to see how the different positions and trajectories of GDR-sociologists had an impact on their approaches to theoretical, epistemological, and methodological questions, and on their understanding and uses of concepts deriving from both Marxist-Leninist and “bourgeois” sociology. In the analysis, I will first compare the social trajectories of two of my interview-partners as paradigmatic of two different sociological habitus depending on their different academic/political socialization, networks, and positions in the field. As a second step, I will present a sketch of the sociological field drawn from 63 curricula of sociologists active in East Berlin in an attempt to pinpoint, on a larger scale, the homologies between the social and symbolic spaces of the field. Thus, the underlying idea is to examine the intersection of the “quasi-structural properties” of the field with its “phenomenological aspects” concerning the “feel for the game.” While the two understandings of field are interdependent, it is in the second one that the physical space as a localized social space played a crucial role in defining the material, social, and cultural constraints and opportunities actors faced which, in turn, influenced their practices and choices.",sociology

Recent claims that we are witness to an ‘affective turn’ and calls for a ‘new sociological empiricism’ sensitive to affect indicate an emerging paradigm shift in sociology. Yet, mainstream sociological study of resistance tends to have been largely unaffected by this shift. To this end, this paper presents a case for the significance of affect as a lens by which to approach the study of resistance. My claim is not simply that the forms of actions we would normally recognize as resistance have an affective dimension. Rather, it is that the theory of affect broadens ‘resistance’ beyond the purview of the two dominant modes of analysis in sociology; namely, the study of macropolitical forms, on the one hand, and the micropolitics of everyday resistance on the other. This broadened perspective challenges the persistent assumption that ideological forms of power and resistance are the most pertinent to the contemporary world, suggesting that much power and resistance today is of a more affective nature. In making this argument, it is a <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">D</jats:styled-content>eleuzian reading of affect that is pursued, which opens up to a level of analysis beyond the common understanding of affect as emotion. I argue that an affective approach to resistance would pay attention to those barely perceptible transitions in power and mobilizations of bodily potential that operate below the conscious perceptions and subjective emotions of social actors. These affective transitions constitute a new site at which both power and resistance operate.",sociology

Furthermore, as a reading of Bateson through the lens of Durkheim will show, Bateson’s theories fail to provide a better understanding of social reality than those of his predecessors. This type of critical analysis demonstrates the weakness of some of Bateson’s central claims and contributes to a more in-depth understanding and reassessment of his ideas from a sociological perspective.

Anti‐colonial Thought and Social Theory.” It proceeds in two parts: I first follow Go's invitation to read and reread Mabel Dove Danquah and Frantz Fanon and explore what their work contributes to our understanding of state‐forms. I then examine the terms of Go's invitation more closely. I contrast Go's juxtaposition of imperial sociology on the one hand and anti‐colonial sociology on the other hand, with the broader range of theoretical traditions and methods, which a practice‐oriented sociology of sociology and an international history of sociology would highlight. I raise the question what “standpoint” adds to the authors Go discusses and the broader range of scholars who have engaged with post‐colonial contexts in their research at this point in time. Calling for consideration of the anti‐colonial standpoint is a particular choice, which has a distinctive heritage in Hegelian‐Marxian projections of the social whole and is in tension with either deep exploration of particular thinkers or the middle‐range theorizing that Go also seems to endorse. Defined at a level of abstraction that is “above” (or underneath) actual conversations in a range of fields and subfields, it can appear as a “test” for scholars who have long engaged with post‐colonial contexts, which can have unintended consequences when coupled with the institutional power and asymmetric insularity of Anglo‐American academia.",sociology

There was something of a reception of Ibn Khaldun in Europe at that time by sociologists and other scholars who were not necessarily involved with Islamic or West Asian studies. In fact, the reception of Ibn Khaldun by modern scholars in the West can be differentiated into Eurocentric or Orientalist as opposed to more disciplinary attitudes. While much has been said about the Eurocentric reception of Ibn Khaldun, less is discussed about the disciplinary approach to Ibn Khaldun among thinkers who wrote when the modern science of sociology was emerging in Europe. This special issue on Ibn Khaldun in the Formative Period of Sociology provides English translations of six articles originally written in Italian, French, German, Polish, Spanish and Turkish between 1896 and 1934. Not all of these articles were written by sociologists.

Latinas experience various physical and symbolic migrations—across and within national borders, social and political contexts, identities, academic disciplines, methodologies, and social movements. Yet Latina feminist experiences, knowledge, and political movement largely remain at the margins of these borders. Through a review of prominent research on gender and migration centered on heteronormativity, reproduction, and the nation‐state, I demonstrate the possibilities of the politics of erased migration as a theoretical intervention in expanding a relational, intersectional sociology of Latinx gender and migration.

These discourses have been reignited in recent years by changes in the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicalised cosmetic procedures. The most popular of these procedures are non‐surgical ‘tweakments’ to the shape and/or appearance of the face, usually through use of ‘injectables’ such as Botox and dermal fillers. This shift in focus from surgical procedures to minimally invasive injections has led more practitioners to join the market of potential providers and a wider variety of consumers to seek them out. This has been accompanied by panic about the risks to bodies and aesthetic standards if stewardship of beauty should fall into the wrong hands. We trace the history of medicalised cosmetic practices and academic discourses on the body, particularly how cosmetic practices are understood to produce the body as gendered and racialised. We then suggest future approaches for exploring the sociological significance of new cosmetic practices. We encourage researchers to explore how imaginaries of (un)desirable bodies shape debates about appropriate use of non‐surgical cosmetic procedures, alongside investigation of the situated intersections of identity that are inscribed on bodies.",sociology

Fourth, following the uncertainty of etiological positions toward childhood behavior problems, this paper will discuss some of the external critiques of medicalization, including the way that lay actors push back against the medicalization process, and concerns about the effectiveness of technologies used to diagnose and treat ADHD.",sociology

I argue that the author’s understanding of barbarism has a significant interpretive potential for the sociological analysis of contemporary radical identities, and suggest some ways to reconsider ‘populism’, thereby redefining the very concept of radicalism. The article starts by introducing the pivotal notions which constitute the conceptual framework of our author.

It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory.

His 2004 American Sociological Association presidential speech was a call to sociologists for increased engagement with broader audiences. Burawoy was not inventing a new kind of sociology, but, rather, underscoring a long tradition of community‐engaged and policy research going back decades. There are two undercurrents in public sociology. The first is about how sociological research gets into the hands of the public outside of the discipline. The second is about how sociological knowledge is produced. “Traditional” public sociologists may communicate but not necessarily interact with publics, for example, through research reports, op‐ed pieces, or expert testimony. “Organic” public sociologists work in concert with local communities, organizations, and social movements in coproducing knowledge.",sociology

Two equations explain how innovation is produced and what its feedbacks are. The equivalency of innovation with new knowledge and adaptiveness connects important theoretical problems. The construct of knowledge involves four components: skills, hardware, software, and ideas. Over time the measurement of innovation has become more precise and has moved to new venues.

It was mostly the product or sequel of what economists (Schumpeter 1954) call the Copernican marginalist revolution in economic theory during the 1870–90s. Specifically, the crux of marginalism was a marginal‐utility theory of exchange value and its extensions (e.g., marginal‐productivity principle of income distribution) in reaction and contrast to the labor‐cost conception in classical political economy. The founders or pioneers of marginalism are commonly considered to be William Jevons (England), Carl Menger (Austria), and Leon Walras (Switzerland/France), who almost simultaneously in 1871–4 “discovered” marginal‐utility value theory as a putative revolutionary alternative to its labor‐based versions in Smith, Ricardo, Mill, Marx, and others. (For instance, Jevons specifically attacked Ricardo and Mill's theories, prompting neoclassical economists like Alfred Marshall to rise in their partial defense.) The term neoclassical economics was invented by (Thorstein Veblen Groenewegen 1995), a heterodox institutional economist, in the early 1900s to indicate that marginalism (e.g., marginal‐utility theory) was, in virtue of utilitarianism and hedonism, essentially continuous with and so “scarcely distinguishable” from classical political economy (which apparently overlooks the opposition of the marginalist revolution to Ricardo et al.'s labor theories of value). In this sense, the terms marginalism and neoclassical economics become interchangeable, though the first term is probably more accurate and precise for describing this stage and type of economic theory. Moreover, historians of economics such as Schumpeter (1954: 919) object that “there is no more sense in calling the Jevons‐Menger‐Walras theory neoclassic than there would be in calling the Einstein theory neo‐Newtonian.” This suggests that neoclassical economics is essentially marginalism (with partial exceptions like Marshall), but not conversely: the marginalist revolution is not newly, but counter‐classical (that is what makes it presumably “Copernican”).",sociology

Accounts provided in a survey of 250 individuals who knew people who had died in the UK are examined. The analysis counters the view that the denial of death is widespread in conditions where religion no longer offers individuals a meaningful narrative for the dying self. Scripts for proclaiming heroic self-identity in the face of death are promoted by cultural experts and appropriated by many lay individuals. This involves a struggle against external and internal enemies to gain knowledge, the opportunity to demonstrate courage and a beatific state of emotional accompaniment in which `carers' and dying people participate. Unlike more traditional forms of heroism, this script deviates from celebrating solely masculine qualities and includes a female heroics of care, concern and emotional expression.  At the same time, some deaths cannot be written into this script, which is particularly well suited to deaths from cancer and AIDs. The deaths of the very old, the mentally confused and sudden unexpected deaths are often difficult to interpret in these heroic terms. Additionally, a rival script exists amongst some lay individuals that stands in opposition to the professional consensus on the desirability of open awareness. This emphasises the benefits of continuing the everyday project of the self oblivious of oncoming death, with others shouldering the burden of awareness in an attempt to protect the dying person against the strain of knowledge. This rival script, however, commands decreasing allegiance in a society where the project of the self is rarely given over to the care of others, and trust is commonly negotiated in confessional moments.",sociology

               This chapter proposes an integral cognitive sociology capable of mediating between the sociocultural and naturalistic approaches that had all along been latent in critical theory but in the wake of the cognitive revolution can now be made explicit. The conviction driving the argument is that critical theory requires this complementary kind of cognitive sociology in order to secure its penetrating multilevel type of analysis and defining action- and praxis-oriented critical capacity. Framed by an autobiographical perspective, the first part traces the emergence of this cognitive sociology by identifying some starting points and prompts, both positive and negative, in the extant writings of relevant critical theorists. The second part is then devoted to an outline of the proposed cognitive sociology in terms of two key concepts: “the cognitive order” of the human sociocultural form of life and “weak naturalism.” The former allows a presentation of what the analysis of the sociocultural form of life according to the flow, structuring effects and dynamics of cognitive properties would entail. The latter allows the identification of the constraints impinging on the sociocultural world that derive from its ontological rootedness in nature. In contrast to strong naturalism, however, the sociocultural dimension is acknowledged as having epistemological priority for social science rather than being demoted to an epiphenomenon. While the thrust of the chapter is that critical theory urgently requires an integral cognitive sociology, it is apparent that contemporary cognitive sociology is as much in need of being complemented by a critical theoretical approach.",sociology

It approaches human families in comparison to other species and the history of hominid evolution. This chapter outlines the main assumptions and recent advances in evolutionary family sociology. The study of parenting and mating is of interest to both sociologists and evolutionists. Our understanding of couple relations, gender equality, and involved fatherhood, deepens as sexual selection theory is combined with family system theories. Grandparenting is another research field for which an integration between Darwinian theory and mainstream family sociology is underway. Questions of helping, conflicts, and kin lineages are central for such studies on cross-generational relations. The Darwinian perspective has focused attention on the effects of genetic relatedness on familial sentiment and behavior and also on the universal patterns characterizing family dynamics. Sociological insights have helped specify cases in which evolutionary predictions need elaboration in order to better capture the variety and complexity of human families.</p>",sociology

The basis of genetics is the observation that the biological constitution of all living things – plants, animals, fish, insects, bacteria, humans, etc. – is shaped by a chemical called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) found in the nuclear material of the cells from which they are all made. The various ways in which this chemical can be made up carry the instructions for the construction, articulation, and operation of cells. A gene is a segment of DNA that carries a particular set of instructions to perform a particular task in relation to cell assembly or functioning. The totality of genes found in an organism is called its genome. The human genome is made up of about 30,000 genes, whose instructions combine to produce the varied bodies recognizable as members of our species,

The addition of the concept of ‘display’ to the sociological tool kit is not only a necessary complement to the important conceptual developments which have taken place in recent years, but is also rich in its potential for further empirical and theoretical work. In developing this theme, the article examines empirical evidence from recent UK studies of family relationships, exploring why ‘display’ is important in contemporary family relationships as well as the process through which it occurs. The article represents an initial exploration of these themes. The author's principal aim is to open up this aspect of family life for debate within the relevant sociological research community, encouraging others to refine the concept as well as to use it.",sociology

The significance of a shared ethnic origin varies with the location and scale of social relations. In local communities relations are multidimensional; ties based on different attributes are balanced against one another and against individual interests. Outside the range of personal acquaintance a shared ethnic origin may be a basis on which individuals are mobilised for collective action and for bargaining with other groups, though some individuals will seek to be free-riders. Mobilisers from elsewhere may induce individuals to change their relative preference for ethnic association, destroy local methods of dispute regulation, and so polarise relations that the participants treat their relations with members of an opposed ethnic group as unidimensional. Outside institutions, including foreign governments, can help resolve ethnic conflicts by providing guarantees that facilitate ethnic bargaining.",sociology

Designed to explain the two basic types of cognitive processing—one autonomous and the other requiring controlled attention, dual-process models became a natural partner for sociological theories of action, with their interest in parsing dispositional and deliberative types of action. This chapter offers an analytical review of the sociological literature that engages with dual-process models. It begins with an outline of the fundamentals of dual-process models in cognitive and social psychology, and follows with an examination of the premises that constitute what has come to be called the sociological dual-process model. It then reviews sociological research that applies dual-process models, dividing this literature into two distinct groups that are separated along sharp epistemological, methodological, and analytical lines. The first group is a largely consistent body of work that follows the premises of the sociological dual-process model, emphasizing the primacy of Type 1 processing, and investigating how this form of cognition shapes action. The second group comprises a more diverse body of work, examines Type 1 and Type 2 processing, and attempts to capture the processes that shape cognition and action. The chapter concludes with remarks about the critiques raised against dual-process models, along with their potential contributions to sociological analysis.",sociology

10.62272/js.v14.a2,"This paper focuses on the theoretical debates in sociology that acted as the driving force in its course of development drawing heavily from the thinking of Alvin Gouldner. Revolutionary transformation in the French society in late eighteenth century and the subsequent social disorder created the background of the development of positivism by Comte with the advocacy of restoring social order. Intermingling of different theories also took place as in the case of positivism furnishing the context for the emergence of structural functionalism. Interpretative sociology brought new dimension to the understanding of social phenomena by highlighting the perspective of the actors instead of the observer. In this vein it also discusses the emergence of intersubjectivity, ethnomethodology and related theoretical views. For obvious reason the paper deals elaborately with the perspective of Marxism. It underlines that structural functionalism presents society as an interwoven equilibrium while Marxism views the same as a conflicting whole with the effect of domination by the ruling class. This paper elaborates on the basic tenets of historical materialism as couched in Marxism. However, Marxist prognosis faltered in advanced capitalist countries of the Western hemisphere calling for new theoretical insight. Within Marxism it happened by examining the causal background of the continuation of capitalist countries, elaborated in this paper in the section on structural Marxism. The premise of sociology also necessitated the emergence of Durkheim and Weber who argued for different perspectives for the understanding of social order. The contributions of system theory and interactionism are duly acknowledged in this paper to weave a comprehensive intellectual tapestry being linked with debates and argumentation. The parallelism of system and individual brought dualism in sociological theory and Anthony Giddens took up attempt to draw a conflation between the two, unfolding a new dimension in the debate ridden sociological theories. The paper concluded with the discussion of Derrida and Lyotard to unfold the novel approach of post-modernism in challenging the claim of universality of modern theories.",sociology

Modern Sociology was produced as a theoretically sophisticated scientific enterprise firmly based on a solid empirical foundation produced by appropriate social research methods (as master-minded by Paul F. Lazarsfeld). The ‘Columbia Tradition’ is an approach, rather than being focussed on any particular subject matter, involved the development of ‘middle-range theory’, often broken-out from classic theory (as propounded by Robert K. Merton), and backed up by efforts at knowledge cumulation and institution building. But the School included a glittering array of important sociologists and hosts of others who extended the work of the two leaders, developing it in further directions, as is expected of any school. This school was sustained by the vision of a developing scientific sociology propounded by its founders, but it faltered as its founders retired from active leadership roles, in addition to being impacted by changes in Columbia University and broader Sociology environments.",sociology

It has been argued here that the normative center (nee non-normative) investigators have actually contributed to the crisis. They have distorted the proper under standing of methodology, both because they were mimicking ideas once extant in mainstream sociology but also because by so doing they were attempting to en sure their own academic legitimacy and survival. These survival efforts, however, are being quickly undermined by the Center's inability to produce significant theo ry. Loy's definition of the nature of sport symbolizes the problem. As an early effort to conceptually organize the field, it appears impressive. But the respect it has gained and the stature it has achieved since it was first written depend on one crucial factor. Heretofore, the work has never been critically examined. Upon examination, the definition can be seen to be rife with inconsistencies, inad equacies, and ambiguities. Consequently, these same problems are abundant in the body of knowledge of the normative center. Stated succinctly, the situation is this: the normative center has not offered a single concept or theory which pushes understanding of sport beyond that gleaned by the insightful fan from the mass media.",sociology

Once a disciplinary ‘pillar’ of teacher education, sociology’s contribution has become less explicit while more integrated, with consequences for disciplinary identity. Here we explore how sociology is taught in teacher education curricula on two fronts. First we outline how sociology is embedded as one of a number of competing perspectives in foundational studies, and its pedagogic consequences. Then we consider the powerful contribution of sociology in literacy studies, amidst public debate about literacy performance. The analysis draws on Bernstein’s distinction between singular disciplinary curriculum design and practically oriented regional curriculum design. We seek to trouble the common-sense binary between theory and practice that structures debates around professional education in higher education more broadly, and to dignify service sociology as a valuable, generative site for the discipline’s future.",sociology

Drawing on critical race theory and research on the practice of affirmative action in organizations, we argue that the diversity embrace subsumes recognition of racialized histories, social relations, and practices in favor of a “color‐blind” rhetoric that reinforces negative assumptions about the academic merit and worthiness of underrepresented minority students (URM). Our review of the status and condition of URM graduate students in sociology departments reveals that minority inclusion is part of a larger strategy that emphasizes individual and group differences rather than corrective action for past discrimination. We find that access and inclusion in graduate programs in sociology have been uneven with relatively few departments producing a majority of URM sociology doctorates. The diversity embrace obscures their continual low representation in graduate programs, fosters professionalization practices detrimental to these students, and undermines efforts to create a “critical mass” of faculty of color. Such practices constitute a racial project that preserves White privilege at the individual and institutional levels.",sociology

Grit, comprising perseverance and passion toward long‐term goals, has received growing attention within academia and from the general public as a strong predictor of achievement. Grit captures an important, noncognitive, underdeveloped aspect of agency not included in life course or stratification studies. Grit can contribute to our understanding about how the subjective beliefs that are typically treated as agency are actually translated into volitional action that constructs one's life course, a crucial potential life course mechanism. This paper suggests incorporating grit into sociological understanding of individual‐level aspects of stratification, moving beyond its current conception anchored fully in psychology, to further understand what it is, where it comes from, and why it is sociologically useful.",sociology

By allowing the artist to speak fully about their work, art sociologists can uncover new social and cultural phenomena and better understand the different motivations underlying art‐making. The following literature highlights the recent tendencies in the sociology of art, explores the “social turn” in art and presents different sociologists who focus on the art practice and the art’s voice. For further development of the field, I suggest the sociology of art needs to catch‐up with the recent tendencies in art by placing the empirical focus on participatory art practices that will not only give us a better understanding about the intricate actions taking place in the art making, but it will also illuminate new layers of social life that are hidden. To conclude, I suggest that sociologists engage with participatory‐based artists to enhance sociology through a public sociology of art.",sociology

The work of Clifford Geertz suggests the two are not mutually exclusive. In his empirical studies he artfully produced `maximal interpretations' that went beyond both extant theories and the immediate data given by participant observation. Maximal interpretations, I argue, claim the epistemic status of sociological explanations. Indeed, the core problems of the philosophy of social science and social theory can be reframed in terms of the difference between relatively uncontroversial `minimal interpretation' and relatively tendentious (but powerful)`maximal interpretation'.The implications of this distinction for research can be made clear by considering, as an example, what is required to explain witch hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America, and the Salem witch trials in particular.",sociology
