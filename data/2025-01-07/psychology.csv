Health Psychology,Regan Gurung,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0031,"<p>Health psychology is an interdisciplinary subspecialty of psychology dedicated to promoting and maintaining health and preventing and treating illness. Franz Alexander and Helen Flanders Dunbar together established the first formal gathering of individuals interested in studying the influences of the mind on health in the 1920s. This movement within the mainstream medical establishment was coined psychosomatic medicine and grew into the American Psychosomatic Society (APS). The new field of psychosomatic medicine had many supporters, which led to the formation of the first society specifically dedicated to the study of mind and body connections. Another movement within the field of medicine, called behavioral medicine, looks at nonbiological influences on health. The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM), a multidisciplinary, nonprofit organization founded in 1978, is dedicated to studying the influences of behavior on health and well-being. Unlike SBM and APS, whose members are overwhelmingly physicians, the American Psychological Association’s Division of Health Psychology (Division 38) is a group specifically for psychologists and came into being in the mid-1970s. Health psychologists pay close attention to the way that thoughts, feelings, behavior, and biological processes all interact with each other to influence health and illness. In many ways health psychology is greater than a subfield within the discipline of psychology, as it is built on theoretical ideas and research findings from many other areas in psychology. For example, many of the ways used to understand why we get stressed and how we cope come from social and personality psychology. The field of health psychology can be divided into three broad natural segments: stress and coping, health behaviors, and issues in health care.

Phenomenological Psychology,Darren Langdridge,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0210,"<p>Phenomenological psychology refers to an approach to psychology that draws on phenomenological, existential, and hermeneutic philosophy. The focus in all such work is on making sense of the meaning structures of the lived experience of a research participant or psychotherapeutic client. That is, in Husserl’s terms—the founder of phenomenological philosophy—we go “back to the things themselves” as they present themselves to consciousness in order to determine the “essence” (eidos) of the phenomenon. There is not one approach to phenomenological psychology, however, with the perspective better being understood as a family of methods and modes of practice. All psychological research and practice within this tradition will have its roots in the thought of Husserl and key concepts therein but will also likely be informed by other philosophical work, such as that of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre from the existential tradition, or Gadamer and Ricoeur from the hermeneutic tradition. Phenomenological psychology has its origins in European psychiatry with the work of Karl Jaspers in the early 1900s, along with figures including Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, Viktor Frankl, Eugene Minkowski, and Jan Hendrick van den Berg. The primary aim of these thinkers was (a) the rejection of traditional notions of psychopathology, in favor of Husserl’s descriptive method of analyzing psychological experience; and (b) the application of ideas from existential philosophy to therapeutic practice. A variety of modes of psychotherapeutic practice have evolved from this early work including Daseinsanalysis, logotherapy, British School existential analysis, and existential-humanistic psychotherapy. The Utrecht School in The Netherlands has been identified as the location of the first attempt to apply phenomenological philosophy to psychological research. Influenced by the work of the psychologist Adrian van Kaam and the philosopher Henry Koren, Amedeo Giorgi (beginning in the early 1970s) developed a systematic phenomenological psychology methodology at Duquesne University in the United States. Other important early figures working to develop phenomenological psychology at Duquesne include Rolf von Eckartsberg, Constance F. Fischer, and Paul F. Collaizi, with the latter developing his own phenomenological method, which is more hermeneutic than the Giorgi method. Another relatively early major methodological development came about in Canada in the late 1970s with the work of the pedagogical researcher Max van Manen, who drew directly on the Utrecht School to develop a hermeneutic phenomenological methodology. Recent developments include methodologies that draw more extensively on hermeneutics or forms of critical social theory or both, including feminist theory. Some of these developments have proven controversial, with ongoing debates in the field about the boundaries and methods of phenomenological psychology.</p>",2018-4-26,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0210,"Phenomenological psychology refers to an approach to psychology that draws on phenomenological, existential, and hermeneutic philosophy.

Computational Psychology,Ron Sun,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0299,"<p>Computational psychology is concerned with understanding the mind and its various functions and domains through developing detailed, mechanistic, process-based models, namely, computational (in a broad sense) models of representations, mechanisms, and processes. It embodies theories in computer algorithms and programs, which are in turn based on artificial intelligence and computer science. That is, it imputes computational processes onto psychological functions, and thereby it produces runnable computational models. Detailed simulations can then be conducted based on computational models. Empirical disciplines, such as cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology, provide empirical data, findings, phenomena, ideas, and other information to computational psychology. Computational psychologists then analyze and abstract them to form coherent theories in computational forms. In turn, these theories impact other disciplines, including those disciplines from which they draw their initial inspirations. Thus, work in computational psychology relies on empirical work from various empirical disciplines, and work in other disciplines in turn is influenced by work from computational psychology. Note that computational models are, mostly, “process theories”—that is, they are meant to answer the question of how human performance and behavior comes about; by what psychological mechanisms, processes, representations, and knowledge; and in what ways exactly. In contrast, it is also possible to formulate “product theories” that provide a functional account of the phenomena but do not commit to a particular psychological mechanism or process. This article emphasizes the former. Note also that, because of the existence of many different or even conflicting viewpoints, paradigms, and theories, this article can only provide a sparse sampling of perspectives and models (especially with regard to various specific psychological or cognitive domains), not exhaustive or complete in any way.

Counseling Psychology,Elizabeth Nutt Williams,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0146,"<p>Counseling psychology is a specialty within psychology that focuses on counseling, research, and assessment in which close attention is paid to individual’s assets and psychological strengths. Counseling psychologists have three primary roles: remedial (e.g., working to help correct problems), preventative (e.g., interventions focused on forestalling problems), and developmental (e.g., skills training and psychoeducational approaches). The primary interventions of the specialty tend to be brief and cover a variety of settings (e.g., counseling, training, consultation, outreach). Gelso, et al. 2014, Counseling Psychology (cited under Reference Works), summarizes the enduring central values of counseling psychology, noting it has (1) an emphasis on a person’s strengths and optimal functioning; (2) a focus on the whole person, with particular emphasis on life-span development and vocational growth; (3) a commitment to advocacy and social justice, maintaining an ongoing awareness of the importance of environmental context and culture; (4) a concentration on brief, educational, and preventive counseling interventions; and (5) a dedication to the scientist-practitioner model. While counseling psychology’s abiding interest in vocational guidance began in 1908 with the establishment of a vocations bureau by Frank Parsons, most view the field of counseling psychology as beginning with the role of psychologists (in assessment of military personnel) in the 1940s during World War II. The Division of Counseling and Guidance (Division 17) of the American Psychological Association was formally established in 1946. Division 17 changed its name in 1951 to the Division of Counseling Psychology, and again in 2003 to the Society of Counseling Psychology.

The first conference for counseling psychology was held in 1951 at Northwestern University. It was at this conference that the scientist-practitioner model of training was formally endorsed. The field has held a major conference approximately every dozen years since then (1964, Greyston Conference; 1973, Vail Conference; 1987, Georgia Conference; 2001, Houston Conference). At each conference, the field strengthened its identity and debated issues of importance to the field, such as social justice initiatives and multicultural competencies. In 1999, Division 17 was one of the founding divisions (along with divisions 35, 44, and 45) of the National Multicultural Conference and Summit (NMCS).

Personality psychology—located within what many argue is the broadest, most encompassing branch of psychological science—can be defined as the study of the dynamic organization, within the individual, of psychological systems that create the person’s characteristic patterns of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings (see Allport 1961, also cited under Gordon Allport). The field of personality psychology is concerned with both individual differences—that is, the way in which people differ from one another—and intrapersonal functioning, the set of processes taking place within any individual person. The area of personality psychology is often grouped with social psychology in research programs at universities; however, these are quite different approaches to understanding individuals. While social psychology attempts to understand the individual in interpersonal or group contexts (i.e., “when placed in Situation A, how do people, in general, respond?”), personality psychology investigates individual differences (i.e., “how are people similar and different in how they respond to the same situation?”). Personality psychology has a long history and, as such, is an extremely large and broad field that includes a large number of approaches.

It is focused on building, enhancing, and optimizing the human capital. Though psychological principles have always been used by humankind in warfare, military psychology as a modern discipline found expression as recently as the First World War. Remarkably, the relationship between military and psychology has been almost symbiotic, the two growing in tandem and benefitting mutually. While the German military was a pioneer in utilizing the expertise of psychologists in the war effort, using aptitude testing for recruitment into different occupation, during the First World War, utilization of psychological expertise by Britain and France remained limited. After entering the First World War in 1917 the United States effectively utilized psychological knowledge in recruitment, classification, and training. Large-scale use of psychology gave impetus to the growth of psychology and resulted in the establishment of the Division of Psychology in the office of the Surgeon General of the US Army in 1917. Psychology in the military grew exponentially during the years of the Second World War.

Data Sharing in Psychology,Joy Kennedy,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0272,"<p>Narrowly defined, data sharing is the practice of making scientific research data available to other researchers. However, the term is often used to include a variety of open-science practices, including making data, methodology (e.g., coding scheme), analytic syntax, and other research materials available to other researchers, as well as the reuse of those resources by others. There are multiple avenues for data sharing, for example data repositories (either subscription-based or free) or direct request to the researcher. Data sharing is a fairly common practice in the life and earth sciences. Excepting a handful of longitudinal projects, psychology lacks this robust historical precedent for sharing data. In fact, in the not-so-distant past, institutional review boards typically required that data be destroyed after a preset period in order to protect participants’ privacy—and some still do. And many researchers still do not take the first step—modifying their informed consent procedures to include explicit consent to share. Although still not frequent, data sharing in psychology is becoming more common. In part, this trend is being driven by the requirements set by publications and funding agencies. For publications, data sharing is intrinsic to transparency and replication of study findings. For funders, data sharing ensures greater return on investment—that expensive and time-consuming primary data collection does not wind up sitting on a dusty shelf, but rather can be reused for secondary data analysis to answer new questions. In psychology as in other fields, technological improvements in storage capacity and computing power have also facilitated data sharing and reuse. While many psychologists are still concerned that data sharing will result in being “scooped” or found in error, there is increasing recognition of the benefits of data sharing. First, data repositories ensure that data are archived, and that the burden of preservation does not fall on the researcher or the researcher’s institution. Sharing also increases the pace of scientific progress, as researchers can build on each other’s work. For example, researchers can learn how other experts approached measurement or coding of a given outcome. In replication studies, inconsistent findings can point to contextual variations in the construct under study, rather than researcher error. And in a field where null findings are often difficult to publish, sharing allows these data to be included in meta-analyses across studies to examine broader impacts.

Correspondence Analysis in Psychology,Michael Greenacre,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0311,"<p>Correspondence analysis (CA) is a statistical method of multivariate analysis, which applies to a rectangular table of categorical data, with a wide range of applications in the social sciences, as well as in ecology, archaeology, and linguistics. This bibliography focuses primarily on its development and applications in the field of psychology, where it is often difficult to grasp the interrelationships between observed variables that are generally on categorical scales. The method has several historical origins and equivalent definitions. One of the earliest, due to the eminent British statistician Ronald A. Fisher, defines the method as a way of quantifying the categories of two categorical variables, that is, assigning scale values to the categories, with the objective of maximizing their discriminatory power, equivalent to maximizing their correlation. This idea was generalized to quantifying more than two categorical variables by the psychologist Louis Guttman. The same idea formed the basis of two research schools, led by Chikio Hayashi in Japan, and Jan de Leeuw in the Netherlands. The French linguist and mathematician Jean-Paul Benzécri realized the geometric interpretation of CA and developed the method as a tool for visualizing categorical data, which is its most popular application today. Simple CA visualizes the rows and columns of a two-way table as points in a spatial map, where the association between the row and column categories can be directly interpreted. When the table is a cross-tabulation called a contingency table, CA thus goes beyond the typical measurement and test of row–column association (e.g., the chi-square test) by explicitly showing what the main features of that association are. The generalization of the method, called multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), analyzes more than two categorical variables simultaneously and is routinely used to understand patterns of response in questionnaire surveys that involve many questions with categorical responses. All forms of CA are variants of principal component analysis (PCA), with two important generalizations of the regular way PCA is defined and used: (i) the distance function used to measure differences between the categories, called the chi-square distance, and (ii) the weighting of the categories proportional to their marginal sums.

Categorical PCA (CatPCA) is also a special restricted case of MCA.</p>",2023-5-26,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0311,"Correspondence analysis (CA) is a statistical method of multivariate analysis, which applies to a rectangular table of categorical data, with a wide range of applications in the social sciences, as well as in ecology, archaeology, and linguistics. This bibliography focuses primarily on its development and applications in the field of psychology, where it is often difficult to grasp the interrelationships between observed variables that are generally on categorical scales. The method has several historical origins and equivalent definitions. One of the earliest, due to the eminent British statistician Ronald A. Fisher, defines the method as a way of quantifying the categories of two categorical variables, that is, assigning scale values to the categories, with the objective of maximizing their discriminatory power, equivalent to maximizing their correlation. This idea was generalized to quantifying more than two categorical variables by the psychologist Louis Guttman. The same idea formed the basis of two research schools, led by Chikio Hayashi in Japan, and Jan de Leeuw in the Netherlands. The French linguist and mathematician Jean-Paul Benzécri realized the geometric interpretation of CA and developed the method as a tool for visualizing categorical data, which is its most popular application today. Simple CA visualizes the rows and columns of a two-way table as points in a spatial map, where the association between the row and column categories can be directly interpreted. When the table is a cross-tabulation called a contingency table, CA thus goes beyond the typical measurement and test of row–column association (e.g., the chi-square test) by explicitly showing what the main features of that association are. The generalization of the method, called multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), analyzes more than two categorical variables simultaneously and is routinely used to understand patterns of response in questionnaire surveys that involve many questions with categorical responses. All forms of CA are variants of principal component analysis (PCA), with two important generalizations of the regular way PCA is defined and used: (i) the distance function used to measure differences between the categories, called the chi-square distance, and (ii) the weighting of the categories proportional to their marginal sums. CA has been developed in a similar way to PCA, for example by introducing linear restrictions, where it is called canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), similarly to redundancy analysis (RDA) for PCA. Categorical PCA (CatPCA) is also a special restricted case of MCA."

Simpson's Paradox in Psychology,Madhur Mangalam,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0301,"<p>Simpson’s paradox—also called the reversal paradox and amalgamation paradox—is a statistical phenomenon in which an apparent paradox arises because aggregate data at the group level (or at the level of a set of groups) can support a conclusion that is either not observed or is opposite from that suggested by the same data before aggregation at the individual level (or at the level of groups). The paradox is resolved when the data are stratified by groups in the statistical modeling. An intuitive example of Simpson’s paradox is the correlation between typing speed and typos. At the group level, the correlation is negative—experienced typists type faster and make fewer typos. However, at the individual level, the correlation is positive—the faster an individual types, the greater the number of typos he/she makes. Thus, it would be fallacious to conclude that the relationship between typing speed and typos observed at the group level holds at the individual level. Simpson’s paradox is especially problematic in physical and social sciences, where statistical trends in point data observed at the group level are often fallaciously used to derive inferences about individuals, or relatively less often, the other way round.

Psychology of Money,"Erik Bijleveld, Lena Schäfer, Dorottya Rusz",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0239,"<p>Around ten thousand years ago, several communities around the world transitioned from a hunter–gatherer lifestyle into an agricultural one. Along with this lifestyle transition, many communities evolved the desire to efficiently store and exchange value. Thus, people invented money, and by now, money plays an important role in most people’s lives. ‘Money’ refers to the institutions people use to store wealth, to measure value, and to exchange goods and services. Also, money encompasses the material objects tied to these institutions, such as coins and banknotes. This article provides a broad overview of the psychological literature on money. In particular, it points the reader to research that addresses the following questions: When and how does money motivate human behavior? When and how does money distract people from working? How does money acquire cultural associations? How do these cultural associations manifest themselves on the behavioral level? How do young children and older adults process money? How does spending money affect people’s feelings? What are the psychological consequences of being wealthy versus being poor? What is the nature of money-related problematic behaviors, such as compulsive spending and pathological gambling? To answer these questions, this bibliography mainly highlights classic and recent psychological research, but it also cites insights from economics, neuroscience, and anthropology.</p>",2019-3-27,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0239,"Around ten thousand years ago, several communities around the world transitioned from a hunter–gatherer lifestyle into an agricultural one. Along with this lifestyle transition, many communities evolved the desire to efficiently store and exchange value. Thus, people invented money, and by now, money plays an important role in most people’s lives. ‘Money’ refers to the institutions people use to store wealth, to measure value, and to exchange goods and services. Also, money encompasses the material objects tied to these institutions, such as coins and banknotes. This article provides a broad overview of the psychological literature on money. In particular, it points the reader to research that addresses the following questions: When and how does money motivate human behavior? When and how does money distract people from working? How does money acquire cultural associations? How do these cultural associations manifest themselves on the behavioral level? How do young children and older adults process money? How does spending money affect people’s feelings? What are the psychological consequences of being wealthy versus being poor? What is the nature of money-related problematic behaviors, such as compulsive spending and pathological gambling? To answer these questions, this bibliography mainly highlights classic and recent psychological research, but it also cites insights from economics, neuroscience, and anthropology."
Categorical Data Analysis in Psychology,David Rindskopf,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0306,"<p>Categorical data are data for which at least one dependent (outcome) variable is nominal or ordinal. Nominal variables, such as gender, ethnicity, religion, and graduation (or successful completion of any course of study), have a limited number of possible values. Categorical variables are generally divided into two major classes: dichotomous (binary) variables, which have two values (e.g., success vs. failure), and polytomous, which have more than two categories. Polytomous variables are further divided into ordered (ordinal) or unordered. Ordinal variables may have a limited number of categories (such as Likert scales) or a potentially unlimited number of categories, usually a count (e.g., number of times a student interrupts a class). Historical treatment of such data normally involved what was termed nonparametric statistics (e.g., chi-square tests of independence), and involved simple data structures (often just two variables).

Clinical Psychology,"Joanna Berg, Rachel Ammirati, Scott O.

Today, clinical psychology is a vibrant profession that has contributed substantially to our understanding of the measurement, diagnosis, causes, and treatment of a host of psychological conditions, including mood, anxiety, personality, psychotic, eating, and sleep disorders. More than two hundred clinical psychology graduate programs are recognized as formally accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA), and two major models of training continue to influence the field. The scientist-practitioner, or Boulder, model was launched following a 1949 conference at the University of Colorado at Boulder. This model, spearheaded by the psychologist David Shakow, is intended to train students broadly to become scientists, clinicians, or both, and encourages them to apply scientific thinking and knowledge to all aspects of their work. Most Boulder-model programs award the PhD degree. The scholar-professional, or Vail, model was launched following a 1973 conference in Vail, Colorado. This model substantially deemphasizes research training in the education of graduate students, and instead focuses on providing students with the knowledge and skills to operate as thoughtful and scholarly psychotherapists and assessors in clinical settings.

Bayesian Statistical Methods in Psychology,Sarah Depaoli,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0277,"<p>The use of Bayesian statistics within psychology is on the rise, and this trajectory will likely continue to accelerate in the coming years. There are many different reasons why a researcher may want to implement Bayesian methodology. First, there are cases where models are too “complex” for traditional (frequentist) methods to handle. Second, Bayesian methods are sometimes preferred if only small samples are available, since the use of priors can improve estimation accuracy with minimal data. Third, the researcher may prefer to include background information in the estimation process, and this can be done via the priors. Finally, Bayesian methods produce results that are rich with detail and can be more informative about the population parameters. Specifically, information surrounding the entire posterior distribution is provided through Bayesian estimation, as opposed to a point estimate obtained through traditional (frequentist) methods. All of these reasons make Bayesian methods attractive to the psychological sciences.

Nature versus Nurture Debate in Psychology,Hunter Honeycutt,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0305,"<p>The nature-nurture dichotomy is a long-standing and pervasive framework for thinking about the causal influences believed to be operating during individual development. In this dichotomy, nature refers to factors (e.g., genes, genetic programs, and/or biological blueprints) or forces (e.g., heredity and/or maturation) inherent to the individual that predetermine the development of form and function. Nurture generally refers to all the remaining, typically “external,” causal factors (e.g., physical and social conditions) and processes (e.g., learning and experience) that influence development. The nature versus nurture debate in psychology deals with disagreements about the extent to which the development of traits in humans and animals reflects the relative influence of nature and nurture. It is commonly stated that psychologists have moved on from asking whether traits (or variation in traits) develop from nature or nurture, to recognize instead that both nature and nurture work together or “interact” to produce outcomes, although exactly how to view the interaction is a matter of much debate. While acknowledging the interaction of nature and nurture, one’s theoretical models and research focus might emphasize the prominence of one over the other. Thus, nativists focus more on the importance of innate factors or forces operating on development, whereas empiricists focus more on experiential or environmental factors. However, not everyone finds value in thinking about development in terms of nature and nurture. By the middle of the twentieth century, some psychologists, biologists, and philosophers began to view nature-nurture as a conceptually deficient and biologically implausible dichotomy that oversimplifies the dynamics of behavior and development.

Game Theory and Psychology,"Andrew M. Colman, Eva M. Krockow",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0192,"<p>Game theory is a branch of decision theory focusing on interactive decisions, applicable whenever the actions of two or more decision makers jointly determine an outcome that affects them all. Strategic reasoning amounts to deciding how to act to achieve a desired objective, taking into account how others will act and the fact that they will also reason strategically. The primitive concepts of the theory are players (decision makers), strategies (alternatives among which each player chooses), and payoffs (numerical representations of the players’ preferences among the possible outcomes of the game). The theory’s fundamental assumptions are (i) that all players have consistent preferences and are instrumentally rational in the sense of invariably choosing an alternative that maximizes their individual payoffs, relative to their knowledge and beliefs at the time; and (ii) that the specification of the game and the players’ preferences and rationality are common knowledge among the players (explained below under Common Knowledge). Game theory amounts to working out the implications of these assumptions in particular classes of games and thereby determining how rational players will act. Psychology is the study of the nature, functions, and phenomena of behavior and mental experience, and two branches of psychology provide bridges to and from game theory: cognitive psychology, concerned with all forms of cognition, including decision making, and social psychology, concerned with how individual behavior and mental experience are influenced by other people. Psychology uses empirical research methods, including controlled experiments, and its usefulness for studying games emerges from three considerations. First, many games turn out to lack determinate game-theoretic solutions, and psychological theories and empirical evidence are therefore required to discover and understand how people play them and how they behave in real-life social interactions with the corresponding strategic structures. Second, human decision makers have bounded rationality and are rarely blessed with full common knowledge; consequently, except in the simplest cases, they do not necessarily choose strategies that maximize their payoffs even when determinate game-theoretic solutions exist. Third, human decision makers have other-regarding preferences and sometimes do not even try to maximize their personal payoffs, without regard to the payoffs of others, and psychological theory and empirical research are therefore required to provide a realistic account of strategic interactions. Psychology has investigated strategic interaction since the 1950s; behavioral game theory, a branch of the emergent subdiscipline of behavioral economics, has used similar techniques since the late 1980s, although a small number of early examples of experimental economics can be traced back to the 1940s.</p>",2017-6-27,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0192,"Game theory is a branch of decision theory focusing on interactive decisions, applicable whenever the actions of two or more decision makers jointly determine an outcome that affects them all.

Work is also becoming complex, as people who participate in the activities at workplace often interact in complex ways. In this scenario, worker motivation is becoming a key challenge as it influences organizational performance. This volume examines issues of motivation, performance, and leadership in Indian organizations, along with consumer concerns in India. It explicates the dynamics of organizational performance and analyses the impact of employees’ negative attitude, affect, and behaviour in the corporate setting. The contributors also study moral and ethical dimensions of the corporate life and look at the way consumption practices have evolved in contemporary India. This volume also presents a model of ethical leadership based on Guna theory and principle of Karma appropriate for Indian setting. It explores the potential of inspirational meta value for revamping the corporate functioning and overcoming corruption and other malpractices."
Nonparametric Statistical Analysis in Psychology,"Gregory J. Privitera, James J. Gillespie",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0221,"<p>While nonparametric testing was first introduced in the early 1700s in a paper that utilized a version of the sign test, most nonparametric tests utilized today were developed later in the twentieth century, primarily since the late 1930s. Nonparametric testing has three unique characteristics that make it advantageous for analysis: (a) it can be used to analyze data that are not scaled, that is, data on a nominal or an ordinal scale of measurement; (b) it generally does not require assumptions about population parameters; and (c) it generally does not require that the distribution in a given population is normal, often referred to as “distribution free” tests. In terms of computation, the analysis of nonparametric tests are achieved without needing the value of a sample mean and sample variance, thereby making it possible for these tests to evaluate “effects” in populations with any type of distribution, that is, these tests can be computed without assumptions related to variability in a population. Two critical concerns highlight the need for the elucidation of nonparametric testing in terms of its role in psychology. First, much of human behavior and performance does not conform to a normal distribution, which drives the need for “distribution free” tests to comprehensively study human behavior. Second, the disclosure and reporting of statistical testing can be problematic.

Trauma Psychology,"Patricia A. Frazier, Emily Mischel Abramowski, Viann Nguyen-Feng, Addie Merians, McKenzie Kaubrys",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0241,"<p>Trauma research often uses the definition of trauma in the diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which in general terms involves experiencing a life-threatening event. Using this definition, the majority of individuals have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, with some demographic groups being at greater risk (e.g., sexual minorities). Nonetheless, many other kinds of events can be distressing besides those that meet the definition of trauma in the criteria for PTSD, including adverse childhood experiences, racial microaggressions, morally injurious events, and historical trauma. Much research on the effects of trauma also focuses on PTSD. This research shows that although most individuals experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, few (5 percent–10 percent) trauma-exposed individuals develop PTSD. Thus, research also has examined resilient outcomes following trauma exposure, defined as stable functioning following adversity. In the developmental literature, resilience refers to adequate long-term adaptation across life domains despite chronic childhood adversity whereas, in the adult trauma literature, resilience has been defined as having minimal symptoms posttrauma. Research in both child and adult samples suggests that resilience is the modal response to trauma and adversity.

Because of the diversity of responses to trauma exposure, an important question concerns which factors predict better or poorer adjustment in response to traumatic events. These risk and protective factors include pretrauma, trauma-related, and posttraumatic characteristics. For example, female gender is a risk factor for PTSD partly because women are at greater risk of sexual violence, which is the trauma type that carries the highest PTSD risk. With regard to posttrauma factors, lack of social support is a particularly important risk factor. Progress has been made in terms of developing effective treatments for preventing and treating PTSD. In the immediate posttrauma phase, psychological debriefing (without emotional processing) is recommended.

Using this definition, the majority of individuals have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, with some demographic groups being at greater risk (e.g., sexual minorities). Nonetheless, many other kinds of events can be distressing besides those that meet the definition of trauma in the criteria for PTSD, including adverse childhood experiences, racial microaggressions, morally injurious events, and historical trauma.

The human species is distinctively characterized by individuals who think and act with a view to their own agency but do so in the contexts of groups and relationships upon which they depend for their very survival, let alone their well-being.

Measurement in Health Psychology Research and Practice,"Marie Johnston, John Weinman, Gozde Ozakinci",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0270,"<p>Health psychology is the investigation of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and health care. It investigates the behavior of people who are healthy or ill as well as practitioners and policymakers delivering or making decisions that influence health care. Measures may be used in studies aiming to elucidate and understand processes to advance theory and evidence, or to gain greater understanding or even intervening to improve health and health-care outcomes. A wide range of research designs are used including observational, intensive longitudinal (or ecological momentary assessment [EMA]), experimental laboratory, pre-post event or intervention, and randomized controlled trials. Frequently investigations measure a target behavior or psychological state and examine (a) whether it can be predicted or influenced by antecedents (events, environments, cognitions, interventions) and (b) whether it predicts or influences consequences, especially health/illness outcomes. Health psychology shares measurement issues that are challenging for psychology in general, including establishing reliability and validity, scaling mental processes, and reactivity of measures. Additionally, self-report measures are frequently used to assess symptoms such as pain or reports of health behaviors such as smoking, and these assessments may be used to assess a clinical condition and to guide clinical decisions. They may be validated against an objective measure, but the objective measure may fail to represent the full range, context, or occurrence of the target construct and can therefore only give an indication rather than a solid assessment of validity of the self-report. Measures are often used to measure change over time, especially change associated with an intervention or a changing clinical state, and therefore need to be repeatable while retaining meaning; sensitivity to change may be more important than test-retest reliability. Longitudinal measurement has been aided by the use of digital mobile technologies, including wearables and automatic measurement of physiological processes. Additionally, physiological functioning, especially autonomic, immune, and cardiac, are commonly measured. Data collected routinely by health-care organizations such as attendance at appointments or health outcomes may be useful, but these data may be incomplete or only give indirect evidence of the target behaviors or outcomes. Finally, the context of measurement may determine what is possible: ill patients could be burdened by a long questionnaire; health-care professionals may have limited time and opportunity to respond to assessments and measures may need to be adapted for a clinical environment.

Reflexivity and the History of Psychology,Jill Morawski,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.469,"<p>Reflexivity, a recursive process of turning back, occurs throughout science. Back-and-forth reflexive processes transpire when the scientist executes self-regard and whenever human science theory incorporates the researcher’s actions. Reflexive processes occur too in the myriad, unavoidable ways that observations of the world depend on scientists’ prior understandings of the world. The multiple forms and complexities of reflexivity pose challenges for all science, yet the challenges are especially pronounced in a science, like psychology, that generates knowledge about human nature. Confronting reflexivity is further impeded by psychology’s markedly scientific (not human scientific) goals to achieve objectivity and value neutrality, and to maintain naturalist assumptions about reality. Yet over the lifespan of scientific psychology some psychologists have faced these challenges and recommended means to acknowledge reflexivity. Their investigations have located, named, and analyzed a set of fallacies associated with disregarding reflexivity. The fallacies include assuming that the psychologist’s conception of cognitive processes are the same as their subject’s; that the psychologist can fully bracket their presuppositions from their observations; that psychological theories need not be relevant to their own scientific thoughts and behaviors; that psychology’s prescribed language for reporting findings accurately describes the phenomenon under investigation; and that psychological knowledge has no consequential effects on the world it predicts and explains. Addressing such fallacies and taking steps to remove them through sustained reflexive awareness is essential to attaining an empirically robust, veridical, and dynamic science.

Temporal Dynamics in Organizational Psychology,"Yannick Griep, Hannes Zacher",10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.32,"<p>The role of time and time dynamics is crucial to our understanding of important Organizational Psychology phenomena such as organizational change, work–family experiences, in-role and extra-role performance, deviance, job insecurity, work design, job crafting, psychological contracts, organizational justice, incivility, talent management, human resource management, organizational decision-making, organizational commitment, personality, leadership, emotions, motivation, team work, employee well-being and health, safety, and so forth. Specifically, the inclusion of time and temporal dynamics is essential to better explain “when” a phenomenon occurs, “what” aspects of the phenomenon are being influenced, “how” these aspects are being influenced, and “why” this influence occurs.

Due to this exponential growth, thoughtful reflection is needed to understand the implications of, and interactions between, the historical context of mindfulness (insights and traditions that have been cultivated over the past 25 centuries) and its recent history (the adaptation and applications within healthcare, therapeutic and modern culture, primarily since the 1980s).
Research has shown that MBIs have significant health benefits including decreased stress, insomnia, anxiety, and panic, along with enhancing personal well-being, perceptual sensitivity, processing speed, empathy, concentration, reaction time, motor skills, and cognitive performance including short- and long-term memory recall and academic performance.

Ecological psychology as social psychology?,Harry Heft,10.1177/0959354320934545,"Several articles published in this journal over a number of years have examined the social dimensions of Gibsonian ecological psychology.

Psychology oblivious to psychology: Some limits on our capacity for processing psychology in society,Ole Jacob Madsen,10.1177/0959354314543969,"George A.

In the decades that followed, according to numerous historical studies, psychology’s influence was vital to the conduct of self-governing that resulted in a globalised therapeutic culture.

The second stage was characterized by the influence of Krausism, a version of German rationalist pantheism imported by Julián Sanz del Río, that reached great acceptance during the 1860s and 1870s among intellectuals opposed to traditional Catholicism. The third stage began in the late 1870s: the reception, adaptation, development, and debate of the “new psychology” flowing from Germany, Great Britain, and France.

History and Systems of Critical Psychology,Thomas Teo,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.663,"<p>Critical psychology comprises a broad range of international approaches centered around theories and practices of critique, power, resistance, and alternatives of practice. Although critical psychology had an axial age in and around the 1970s, many sources can be found decades and even centuries earlier. Critical psychology is not only about the critique of psychology, which is a broader historical and theoretical field, but about doing justice in and through theory, justice with and to groups of people, and justice to the reality of society, history, and culture as they powerfully constitute subjectivity, as well as the discipline and profession of psychology. Doing justice in and through psychological theory has a strong basis in Western critical approaches, representing a privileged position of reflection in Euro-American research institutions. Critical psychologists argue that traditional psychology is missing its subject matter and hence is not doing justice in methodology, and its practices of control and adjustment are not doing justice to the emancipatory possibilities of human agency or human science. Critical psychologists who are attempting to do justice with and to human beings are not neglecting the onto-epistemic-ethical domain, but are instead focusing on people, often marginalized or oppressed groups. Critical psychologists who want to do justice in history, culture, and society have argued that traditional psychological practice means adaption and adjustment. This means that not only subjectivity, but also the discipline and profession of psychology need to be connected with contexts. Psychologists have attempted to conceptualize the relationship between society and the individual, as well as the ability of humans not only to adapt to an environment but to change their living conditions and transform the status quo. This conceptualization also means providing concrete analyses of how current society, based in neoliberal capitalism, not only impacts individuals but also the discipline of psychology. Despite the complexities of critical psychology around the world, critical psychologists emphasize the importance of reflexivity and praxis when it comes to changing the conditions of social reality that create mental life. Given that subjectivity cannot be limited to intra-psychological processes, critical psychologists attend to relational and structural societal realities, requiring inter- and transdisciplinarity in the discipline and profession.</p>",2021-3-25,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.663,"Critical psychology comprises a broad range of international approaches centered around theories and practices of critique, power, resistance, and alternatives of practice.

The Role of the Expert Witness in Forensic Psychology,"Camilla Beeley, Gabriele Trupp, Daniel Murrie",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0319,"<p>The legal system routinely relies on experts to help shed light on scientific or technical matters that are usually beyond the knowledge of the judges and attorneys involved, or the layperson jurors who render verdicts in many cases. These experts can come from virtually any discipline, because virtually any subject matter can become a focus of litigation. Experts from any subfield of psychology (e.g., developmental, cognitive, social, or industrial-organizational psychology) may testify when their input is relevant. Of course, the broad discipline of forensic psychology—that is, psychology applied to legal matters—most often features experts providing input to the legal system. Furthermore, this field of forensic psychology has generated much of the research addressing expert testimony, and that research is potentially instructive to expert witnesses from any discipline. Expert witnesses can be retained by either side in adversarial proceedings, but judges—following legal rules of evidence—make the final decision as to whether the expert is admitted to testify. Judges may also independently appoint an expert, though this occurs far less often. Regardless of how the expert was retained or appointed, experts in psychology should testify in a manner consistent with the American Psychological Association’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, as well as the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology. Though their testimony must be honest and objective, experts also strive to be effective, delivering testimony that is clear and compelling.

Intersectionality and the History of Psychology,"Alexandra Rutherford, Tal Davidson",10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.468,"<p>As a conceptual and analytic framework, intersectionality has informed, and can transform, how scholars approach psychology and its history. Intersectionality provides a framework for examining how multiple social categories combine in systems characterized by both oppression and privilege to affect the experiences of those occupying the intersections of these social categories. The concept has its origins in the writings of Black feminists and critical race theorists in the 1970s and 1980s. Since that time, many critical debates about the definition, uses, and even misuses of intersectionality have been put forward by scholars in many fields. In psychology, the uptake of intersectionality as a methodological and epistemological framework has been undertaken largely by feminist psychologists. In this context, intersectionality has been used as both a logic for designing research, and as a perspective from which to critique the perpetuation of intersectional oppression latent in mainstream psychological research. In addition, intersectionality has also been applied to writing histories of psychology that attend to the operation of multiple intersecting forms of oppression and privilege. For example, historians of psychology have taken up intersectionality as a way to approach the intersections of scientific racism, sexism, and heterocentrism in the history of psychology’s concepts and theories. Intersectionality also has the potential for generating a more sophisticated historical understanding of social activism by psychologists.

Cerebral Palsy From a Developmental Psychology Perspective,Karen Lidzba,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.114,"<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as non-progressive damage to the brain at or around birth, which leads to varying symptoms depending on the extent and location of damage. The leading symptom is sensory-motor impairment of varying expression, but additional perceptual, cognitive, and socio-emotional symptoms are common.

Parenting Styles,No authors,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0289,"<p>Parenting styles reflect variations in the attitudes and practices of parents, and comprise discrete parenting behaviors. “Parenting style” refers to a cluster of parental practices that produce relatively stable and identifiable patterns in child adjustment outcomes.

Research on parenting evolved out of an increased interest in leadership styles, and particularly authoritarian personality, that emerged following World War II. The dimensions underlying leadership styles could be applied to parenting, and several researchers were simultaneously engaged in examining the dimensions underlying parenting behaviors.

The Psychology of Hearing Loss,"Christopher J. Plack, Hannah H.

Hearing loss is defined clinically in terms of pure-tone audiometric thresholds: the lowest sound pressure levels that an individual can detect when listening for pure tones at various frequencies. Audiometric thresholds can be elevated by damage to the sensitive hair cells of the cochlea (the hearing part of the inner ear) caused by aging, ototoxic drugs, noise exposure, or disease. This damage can also cause reductions in frequency selectivity (the ability of the ear to separate out the different frequency components of sounds) and abnormally rapid growth of loudness with sound level. However, hearing loss is a heterogeneous condition and audiometric thresholds are relatively insensitive to many of the disorders that affect real-world listening ability. Hair cell loss and damage to the auditory nerve can occur before audiometric thresholds are affected. Dysfunction of neurons in the auditory brainstem as a consequence of aging is associated with deficits in processing the rapid temporal fluctuations in sounds, causing difficulties in sound localization and in speech and music perception. The impact of hearing loss on an individual can be profound and includes problems in communication (particularly in noisy environments), social isolation, and depression. Hearing loss may also be an important contributor to age-related cognitive decline and dementia.</p>",2022-11-22,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.894,"The psychology of hearing loss brings together many different subdisciplines of psychology, including neurophysiology, perception, cognition, and mental health.

The History of Psychology in Brazil,Regina Helena de Freitas Campos,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.753,"<p>Studies of the history of Brazilian psychology generally focus on the reception and circulation of Western psychological theories and techniques and their application in research and practice within the country. This approach must be complemented by studying the transformation and production of psychological knowledge originating in Brazilian culture, including its popular levels, and its interaction with imported ideas. There are at least four sources that participate in the formation of Brazilian culture: the native Indians’ ideas on human nature and development; the contributions of African culture to the understanding of the psychological world brought by the Africans sold into slavery and transferred to Brazil between the 16th and the 19th centuries; European views received through the teaching of philosophical psychology, introduced into Catholic educational institutions in colonial times; and scientific psychology, introduced into public medical schools and teacher training institutions from the 19th century onward. The profession of psychologist, born of the confluence of the professions of physician and educator, was regulated in 1962. The tasks of the psychologist were then defined: psychological evaluation through mental tests and the diagnosis of mental and behavioral troubles, psychological guidance, and psychotherapy. The profession was primarily designed for the intellectual and social elites. From the 1990s onward, with the increasing numbers of graduates, the participation of psychologists in public health, education, and social services institutions expanded rapidly. In consequence, psychologists began to develop intervention practices and techniques more fitted to the demands of the low-income population, immersed in the beliefs and practices of Brazilian popular culture. This dialogue contributed to the construction of innovations in psychology, making it more sensitive to the worldviews arising from the cultures that compose the Brazilian cultural landscape and producing original contributions with a profound impact on modern psychology. Today, Brazilian psychology professionals constitute one of the largest communities of psychologists in the world, with a strong presence in mental health, educational, and social services networks.

The profession of psychologist, born of the confluence of the professions of physician and educator, was regulated in 1962. The tasks of the psychologist were then defined: psychological evaluation through mental tests and the diagnosis of mental and behavioral troubles, psychological guidance, and psychotherapy. The profession was primarily designed for the intellectual and social elites. From the 1990s onward, with the increasing numbers of graduates, the participation of psychologists in public health, education, and social services institutions expanded rapidly. In consequence, psychologists began to develop intervention practices and techniques more fitted to the demands of the low-income population, immersed in the beliefs and practices of Brazilian popular culture. This dialogue contributed to the construction of innovations in psychology, making it more sensitive to the worldviews arising from the cultures that compose the Brazilian cultural landscape and producing original contributions with a profound impact on modern psychology. Today, Brazilian psychology professionals constitute one of the largest communities of psychologists in the world, with a strong presence in mental health, educational, and social services networks. The work of psychologists, strongly influenced by theoretical perspectives that emphasize the relationship between sociocultural dynamics and psychological elaboration, is at present considered relevant in the realization of human rights ideals."
Emotion,Keith Oatley,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0131,"<p>Emotion is central to our experience of others and of ourselves. Since the early 1950s it has come fully onto the agenda of psychology, and takes its place firmly alongside such functions as perception, memory, and thinking. A human emotion occurs typically when an inner concern is affected by an event in the outer world, usually about another person. Sometimes, of course, the inner concern meets an inner event, a thought, but the more frequent cause, a meeting of inner and outer makes emotion of special importance in psychology. The best current conception is that when a concern is affected by an outer or inner event, an emotion is the process that then gives urgency and priority to one goal or course of action and thought, while relegating others to a background for some period. Often the emotion has bodily accompaniments, some of which occur in readiness for the urgent action. Imagine you are crossing the road, holding the hand of a five-year-old child. A car screeches to a halt right beside you. You stop your road-crossing, grab the child, and jump back onto the curb. You look to make sure that the child is alright. Your heart thumps in your chest. You can’t help thinking about the implications of what has happened. The concern is for safety of the child and yourself. The event is being nearly run over. The emotion is fear. The urgent priority is to reach safety. Emotions of other kinds, too, typically involve patterns of action, bodily changes, and patterns of self-sustaining thought, which often are about our relationships with others. In our relationships, emotions of affection, of anxiety, and of conflict are fundamental to our social lives. Questions that have directed thinkers on emotions over the centuries include how the urgency, sometimes the seeming inexorability, of emotions might be modified, how individual lives are affected by emotions, and how friendships, families, and societies are shaped by them. Although emotions are psychological, their significance has become important also in psychiatry, sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy, history, and literary study.</p>",2013-10-29,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0131,"Emotion is central to our experience of others and of ourselves.

Pretrial Publicity,No authors,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0290,"<p>Pretrial publicity (PTP) refers to media coverage of criminal and civil cases prior to trial. Every era has its high-profile cases involving individuals and businesses—e.g., Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Boston Bomber), Enron, Timothy McVeigh, O. J. Simpson, John Hinckley, Patty Hearst, John Mitchell, Sam Shepperd, Bruno Richard Hauptmann (Lindbergh baby kidnapping), Sacco and Vanzetti. Serious and notorious crimes and cases involving celebrities tend to receive the most media attention. Much media attention will operate to the detriment of criminal and civil defendants—reporting may emphasize the dastardliness of the defendant’s actions, the effects of those acts on victims, the evidence against the defendant, opinions about the defendant’s guilt expressed by law enforcement personnel, and the like. Whenever a case receives substantial PTP—and especially when the PTP is negative—questions arise about the likelihood that a defendant can receive a fair trial. The concern is that the substantial PTP will bias prospective jurors against the defendant and result in a verdict driven by PTP rather than trial evidence. Concerns about the media potentially biasing trials pit First Amendment guarantees of a free press against Sixth Amendment rights of defendants to “a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.” Of course, if media coverage has been substantial and negative, a number of questions arise: has the deck been stacked against a defendant? To what extent? How can this be proven? If there is improper bias, what are the solutions—delay the trial? Give the defendant expanded opportunities to find unbiased jurors? Rely on judges to instruct jurors to put aside their biases (and rely on jurors to do so)? Change the trial to another venue—if there is one where the PTP has not been so voluminous or negative?

Resilience,Anthony Mancini,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0050,"<p>Resilience is the capacity to maintain stable levels of functioning, as well as positive emotions and generative experiences, following or under conditions of significant adversity. Resilience researchers have largely focused on two broad types of adversity: (1) acute and time-limited events that are outside the range of ordinary experience, such as physical or sexual assault, traumatic injury, disease, natural disaster, mass casualty events, war, and interpersonal loss; and (2) chronic enduring stressors, usually experienced in childhood, such as neglect, socioeconomic disadvantage, oppressive political conditions, and physical or mental abuse. Although these two types of adversity necessarily entail different methods and theoretical frameworks, research findings from both literatures have converged on a common conclusion: resilience is common, even under the most extreme adversity. The empirical study of psychological resilience as such is a relatively recent phenomenon—until about thirty-five years ago it drew almost no serious scientific attention. Recently, however, the resilience literature has burgeoned at an exceptional rate. Unfortunately, the study of resilience has been plagued by definitional controversies and methodologically uninformative research. One important cleavage concerns the way resilience is defined and measured. A substantial body of research defines resilience as a personality construct; another literature insists that resilience is defined as an outcome (or process) in response to the experience of significant adversity. Although both approaches have produced relevant and informative research, it is worth noting that, in sheer volume, most resilience research is now devoted to the personality-as-resilience approach. Because these studies often do not study reactions to a marker event, rely exclusively on self-report scales, and employ cross-sectional designs, they are usually (but not always) of inferior methodological quality. Consistent with the suggestions of a number of scholars, this latter approach is described here as “resiliency,” not resilience.

Marulić’s manuscript is likely lost, and neither of the other two defined the term. Even the interests of the three went apparently in different directions. Marulić focused on poetry and history, Freig on physica, and Goclenius on theological issues. Nevertheless, they had something in common, and this may represent the gate through which the ways they conceived the term can be understood. They all dealt with the soul, but also that it was a highly disputable concept and not uniformly understood. Another commonality was the avoidance or reinterpretation of Aristotle’s philosophy.

Goclenius belonged partly to the same movement. Consequently, they all shared a common interest in texts and language. This is just one, yet quite important aspect of the origin of psychology as a science. Thus, these text- and humanity-oriented aspects of psychology are traceable from the very beginning.

Why Humanistic Psychology Lost Its Power and Influence in American Psychology,David N. Elkins,10.1177/0022167808323575,"Why did humanistic psychology lose its power and influence in American psychology?

Injury Prevention in Sport and Performance Psychology,Monna Arvinen-Barrow,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.171,"<p>This article aims to provide a narrative overview on injury prevention in sport and performance psychology. Research and applied interest in psychological injury prevention in sport and performance psychology has risen in popularity over the past few decades. To date, existing theoretical models, pure and applied research, and practice-based evidence has focused on conceptualizing and examining psychological injury occurrence and prevention through stress-injury mechanisms, and predominantly in sport injury settings. However, given the inherited similarities across the different performance domains however, it is the authors’ belief that existing injury prevention knowledge can be transferable beyond sport but should be done with caution. A range of cognitive-affective-behavioral strategies such as goal setting, imagery, relaxation strategies, self-talk, and social support have been found beneficial in reducing injuries, particularly when used systematically (a) prior to injury occurrence as part of performance enhancement program and/or as a specific injury prevention measure, (b) during injury rehabilitation, and (c) as part of a return-to-activity process to minimize the risk of secondary injuries and reinjuries. Existing theoretical and empirical evidence also indicates that using cognitive-affective-behavioral strategies for injury prevention are effective when used as part of a wider, multi-modal intervention. Equally, such interventions may also need to address possible behavioral modifications required in sleep, rest, and recovery. Considering the existing empirical and anecdotal evidence to date, this paper argues that injury prevention efforts in sport and performance psychology should be cyclical, biopsychosocial, and person-centered in nature. In short, injury prevention should be underpinned by recognition of the interplay between personal (both physical and psychological), environmental, and contextual characteristics, and how they affect the persons’ cognitive-affective-behavioral processes before, during, and after injury occurrence, at different phases of rehabilitation, and during the return to activity or retirement from activity process.

Psychology Unified: From Folk Psychology to Radical Enactivism,Daniel D.

The first section advances the view that a principled way of characterizing psychology's subject matter is what is required if it is to be regarded as a special science. In this light, section two examines why and how cognitivism continues to be regarded as the best potential unifier for the discipline. But the third section exposes a serious problem about the scope of cognitivism that occurs because it ascribes properties to basic minds that only belong to more sophisticated minds built atop them. In a nutshell, the root problem is that cognitivism relies on folk psychological models of mental states when it assumes that all mentality is contentful. Although this gives cognitivism its intuitive appeal, it also makes it too limited to provide a general model of the mind. Radical enactivism's way of understanding mentality as embodied activity, it is argued, avoids this and provides a more appropriate means of understanding basic forms of mentality.

Bias is a generic term for any systematic errors in the measurement that endanger the comparability of cross-cultural data; bias results in invalid comparative conclusions.

In understanding the psychology of abusive supervision, both employee perceptions and leader behaviors are relevant to employee reports of abuse, and various factors can lead to abusive supervision. Supervisors may enact hostile behaviors for a variety of reasons, including their past experiences, personality traits, employee characteristics and behaviors, and a failure of supervisors to self-regulate their behavior due to stressors in their environment. As a consequence of abusive supervision, employees often experience a number of negative effects, including adverse mental health outcomes.

Culture and Psychology: Perspective of Cross-Cultural Psychology,Durganand Sinha,10.1177/097133360201400102,"In spite of the heritage of cultural orientation the mainstream psychology accords only a peripheral place to culture in the study of behaviour. In its practice it became culture blind as well as culture bound. Experimental psychology eclipsed culture. However, as humans are natural and cultural beings there is need to have a culturally rooted psychology. The cross- culture psychology has recognised this and different kinds of culturally relevant studies have been undertaken. They vary with reference to the entry of culture in the psychological arena.

Coping Processes,Benjamin Gottlieb,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0143,"<p>As ubiquitous as it is in everyday life, in media accounts of disasters, and in old and new cinema, it has proved difficult for investigators to capture the coping process in a way that is faithful to its complexity and dynamic character. Lazarus and Folkman’s groundbreaking work on the cognitive and behavioral ways that people deal with the alarms of life is replete with phrases like “constantly changing,” “process-oriented,” and “contextual,” signaling that the landscape surrounding the study of coping is steep and treacherous, and certainly not for the faint of heart (Stress, Appraisal, and Coping. NY: Springer, 1984). Even their definition of coping is daunting: “constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding a person’s resources” (p. 141). Indeed, the many empirical studies, literature reviews, and conceptual papers launched in the wake of their formulations of the appraisal and coping process have borne out the challenges that await those entering this field of study. They range from such fundamental questions as how coping differs from ordinary and routine behaviors and thoughts to profound questions about the contribution that coping makes to the survival of the human species. The principal foci of coping research since the late 20th century have been the measurement of coping; productive exploration of particular modes of coping, notably social support and social comparison; examination of coping with specific life stressors; cultural variations in coping; and recent research on proactive and religious/spiritual coping.

Person Perception,Sheila Cunningham,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0136,"<p>“Person perception” is an element of social psychology concerning how we process information about people. The term is somewhat misleading because person perception does not deal with perception per se. Rather, it concerns social processing issues like what information we extract when we see other people, how we interpret what we see, and how this interpretation influences our subsequent behavior. Research in person perception has focused on the social and cognitive biases that influence our interpretation of others, particularly of people we do not know (rather than intimate others). For example, models of person perception can offer accounts of what we remember about the person who serves us coffee, our impression of the couple sitting behind us on the bus, and how we feel when someone in our social group performs poorly on a task. Research has highlighted the non-veridical nature of person perception, revealing a number of biases that are relied upon in order to cope with the enormous complexity of social information processing. These biases include Attribution Errors, Context Effects, and the most widely studied element of person perception: social categorization. Social categories, or stereotypes, can have a significant influence on person perception, providing a framework through which the processing of stereotype-consistent information is facilitated. Dual-process models predict the situations in which social cognition is dominated by categorization, rather than individuation. Social categories also influence our sense of identity. The tendency to identify with particular “in-groups” and denigrate “out-group” members is modeled in Social Identity Theory (see Social Identity: Us and Them) and the related Self-Categorization Theory.

Katherine Mansfield and Vitalist Psychology,Clare Hanson,10.3366/edinburgh/9781474417532.003.0003,"<p>This essay argues that the vitalist psychology of William James and particularly Henri Bergson shaped Mansfield’s understanding of the mutability and multiplicity of the self. It suggests that Bergson’s emphasis on the heterogeneity of consciousness finds an echo in the distinctiveness of Mansfield’s characterisation, as she tracks the fluid interplay between different levels and intensities of consciousness. Drawing on the vitalist understanding of personality, it argues that Mansfield tracks the expression and transmission of emotion between characters in terms of affect and involuntary action,  disclosing the porosity of the self and its openness to the unpredictability of human interactions.

It suggests that Bergson’s emphasis on the heterogeneity of consciousness finds an echo in the distinctiveness of Mansfield’s characterisation, as she tracks the fluid interplay between different levels and intensities of consciousness. Drawing on the vitalist understanding of personality, it argues that Mansfield tracks the expression and transmission of emotion between characters in terms of affect and involuntary action,  disclosing the porosity of the self and its openness to the unpredictability of human interactions.

Cognitive–Behavioral Theory in Sport and Performance Psychology,Faye F. Didymus,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.144,"<p>The cognitive–behavioral model of psychotherapy holds cognition at the core of psychological problems and disorders. The theoretical foundations of this model imply that dysfunctional thinking is common to all psychiatric disorders, psychological problems, and medical problems with a psychological component, and that changing an individual’s cognition results in causal changes in emotions and behaviors. In addition, when working with the cognitive–behavioral model, practitioners acknowledge that ongoing cognitive formulation is the basis of effective practice; that working with an individual’s beliefs about themselves, the world, and others results in sustained change; and that neurobiological changes occur following cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT). The cognitive–behavioral model has been successfully applied in many domains (e.g., clinical, occupational, and sport psychology) where interventions are framed around the beliefs that characterize a presenting issue. Cognitive restructuring is one technique for implementing CBT that has been applied in sport and performance psychology. This technique is particularly relevant to performance domains because of the focus on cognitive formulation; the underpinning associations between cognition, emotion, and behavior; and the links between positively valenced emotions and superlative performance. Findings of sport psychology research extend the application of CBT beyond clinical populations and highlight the usefulness of cognitive–behavioral approaches for optimizing experiences of and performance in sport.</p>
               <p>Some would argue that the first scientifically testable paradigm that was built on the cognitive–behavioral model of psychotherapy, and came chronologically slightly before CBT, is rational emotive behavior theory (REBT). Because both CBT and REBT share cognitive–behavioral roots, they have many similarities in their underpinning assumptions and in the ways that they are applied. REBT, however, focuses on rational and irrational beliefs and the links between an individual’s beliefs and his or her emotions and performance. REBT has a more philosophical focus with motivational theoretical roots when compared to other CBT approaches. Distinguishing features of REBT also lie in the techniques used and, hence, the way in which the underlying principles of the cognitive–behavioral model are applied. Disputing is the applied foundation of REBT and is a method of questioning an individual’s beliefs that generate emotional responses. This technique aims to help an individual recognize and adjust flaws in his or her thinking to work toward a more functional philosophy. Research that has used REBT in sport and performance contexts is sparse but that which does exist highlights the approach as a promising one for optimizing athletes’ beliefs and their emotional, behavioral, and physiological responses.</p>",2018-12-20,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.144,"The cognitive–behavioral model of psychotherapy holds cognition at the core of psychological problems and disorders.

Decolonial Perspectives on Psychology and Development,"Glenn Adams, Annabella Osei-Tutu, Adjeiwa Akosua Affram",10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.514,"<p>Standard constructions of history pose a celebratory narrative of progress via modern individualist development. In contrast, decolonial perspectives emphasize the coloniality inherent both in Eurocentric modernity and in the individualist selfways associated with Eurocentric modernity.

Research in West African settings illuminates these forms of epistemic violence. Standard accounts tend to pathologize West African ways of being as immature or suboptimal in relation to a presumed universal developmental pathway toward psychological autonomy. A decolonial response, rooted in decolonial perspectives of Southern theory or epistemology, follows two analytic strategies that disrupt standard accounts. One strategy draws upon local understanding to illuminate the adaptive value of West African patterns.

There he promoted science and welcomed the new psychology that was emerging, even supporting his students to pursue psychology graduate study in Europe.

Fritz Heider,Marion Schmidt,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0255,"<p>Fritz Heider (b. 1896–d. 1988) was an Austrian-American Gestalt and social psychologist. He is considered one of the founding fathers of interpersonal social psychology, contributing in particular his theories of attribution, balance, and motivation. (For attribution theory see the Oxford Bibliographies in Psychology article “Attribution Theory” by Bertram F. Malle and Joanna Korman) Studying in Graz and Berlin, he was influenced both by the Berlin school of Gestalt psychology under Wertheimer, Köhler, and Koffka and the Graz school under Alexius Meinong, as well as by his lifelong friendship with Kurt Lewin. He emigrated to the United States in 1930 to take a joint position at Smith College and the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts. In 1947, he took a position as professor of psychology at the University of Kansas department of psychology, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was married to Gestalt and child psychologist Grace Moore Heider, with whom he also collaborated professionally during their time at the Clarke School. Heider’s approach was not laboratory-based, but philosophical and observational. He was a close observer of how people interact with each other and their surroundings, and also analyzed stories, aphorisms, fables, and fairy tales for generalizable narratives of human behavior. Heider believed that individuals use a kind of naïve or common-sense psychology to explain the behavior of others; this common-sense psychology thus shapes their perception of and interaction with their social world. For decades, he collected and systematized his observations in his notebooks, which were later published. While he was a meticulous and nuanced observer, he was not a prolific writer. Open to different influences, he long grappled with how to systematize human behavior into a generalizable theoretical system of social interaction. Influenced by Kurt Lewin, he sometimes tried to capture interpersonal behavior in a kind of mathematical shorthand, though he never lost sight of the essentially human dimension of his material. Apart from his autobiography, he only published four monographs: in 1927, his revised thesis, Ding und Medium; in 1940 and 1941, together with his wife, two monographs on the psychology of deafness; and in 1958 The psychology of interpersonal relations, which is considered his main work and a seminal contribution to social psychology. Beyond these works, Heider published about a dozen articles on various aspects of phenomenology, Gestalt and social psychology, and the history of psychology. He had few graduate students but nevertheless influenced younger generations through his seminars and his traveling and teaching abroad.</p>",2019-10-30,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0255,"Fritz Heider (b. 1896–d. 1988) was an Austrian-American Gestalt and social psychologist.

Heider believed that individuals use a kind of naïve or common-sense psychology to explain the behavior of others; this common-sense psychology thus shapes their perception of and interaction with their social world. For decades, he collected and systematized his observations in his notebooks, which were later published. While he was a meticulous and nuanced observer, he was not a prolific writer. Open to different influences, he long grappled with how to systematize human behavior into a generalizable theoretical system of social interaction. Influenced by Kurt Lewin, he sometimes tried to capture interpersonal behavior in a kind of mathematical shorthand, though he never lost sight of the essentially human dimension of his material. Apart from his autobiography, he only published four monographs: in 1927, his revised thesis, Ding und Medium; in 1940 and 1941, together with his wife, two monographs on the psychology of deafness; and in 1958 The psychology of interpersonal relations, which is considered his main work and a seminal contribution to social psychology. Beyond these works, Heider published about a dozen articles on various aspects of phenomenology, Gestalt and social psychology, and the history of psychology. He had few graduate students but nevertheless influenced younger generations through his seminars and his traveling and teaching abroad."

Clinical Neuropsychology,Bruce Caplan,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0040,"<p>Clinical neuropsychology is the psychological specialty that seeks to elucidate brain-behavior relations through the study of the neurobehavioral consequences of various forms of brain damage or dysfunction in humans. Historically, clinical neuropsychologists were concerned primarily with assessment and diagnosis of brain dysfunction (especially localization of lesions), but recent conceptualizations emphasize evaluation of individuals’ “neuropsychological topography” (i.e., establishing their cognitive strengths and weaknesses) and also encompass rehabilitation of neuropsychological deficits. The assessment aim of clinical neuropsychology is achieved through administration of tests of such cognitive functions as attention, language, perception, memory, and executive abilities, as well as measures of personality and emotional state. These strategies are increasingly applied to medical conditions (e.g., heart failure, diabetes, liver disease) primarily affecting body systems not commonly thought of as “neurological” but which may have consequences for the functional integrity of the brain. Clinical neuropsychological assessment has also come to play an important role in forensic proceedings, especially in personal injury cases where there may be traumatic brain injury–related cognitive decline or those where various forms of competence are at issue. Other contemporary developments involve the use of neuropsychological tests to predict daily life activities (e.g., money management, driving, return to work) and to help shape multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. This article begins with a brief review of the history of clinical neuropsychology. A section on relevant neuroanatomy addresses the various brain bases of the behavioral phenomena of interest. The growing roster of medical and psychiatric conditions studied with clinical neuropsychological methods is noted and the methods themselves are reviewed, as are the several factors—other than brain functioning—that can influence performance on neuropsychological tests.

Hans Eysenck,Rod Buchanan,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0262,"<p>Hans Jurgen Eysenck (b. 1916–d. 1997) was a towering figure in personality psychology, notable for the audacity of his theorizing, the expansive scope of his empirical research, and the often-controversial views he expressed. Eysenck was the most significant figure in the history of British psychology by almost any measure. He is also likely to remain so because historical circumstances ensured he had an impact on a developing discipline that can never be duplicated. Eysenck was born in Berlin in 1916 at the height of the Great War, the only child of German film and stage performers Ruth Werner (aka Helga Molander) and Eduard Eysenck. The toxic prewar political climate in Germany saw him emigrate to England in 1934 soon after finishing secondary school. Almost by accident, Eysenck took up psychology at University College, London, and was mentored by Cyril Burt. He was almost interred as an enemy alien during the early stages of the war but was subsequently recruited by Aubrey Lewis in 1942 to lead the psychology program at Mill Hill Emergency Hospital – which functioned as the relocated Maudsley Hospital at the time. After the war, Lewis founded the Institute of Psychiatry, adjacent and affiliated with the Maudsley in south London. By 1955, Eysenck was made full professor within an independent psychology department at the institute and remained there for the rest of his career. Eysenck took the individual differences approach pioneered by Spearman and Burt to a new level. He developed a distinctively programmic approach that began with his derivation of three key dimensions of personality: neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism. Much of Eysenck’s later research explored how these dimensional differences played out across a wide variety of areas. Eysenck also attempted to give his personality dimensions a neurobiological basis. Eysenck’s research legacy was assured by his huge output—at least eighty-five books and more than a thousand scientific papers, many highly cited. He also laid the blueprint for the development of clinical psychology in Britain, founded several journals and professional associations, and trained many students. Yet Eysenck was full of contradictions. He advocated a no-nonsense, empirical rigor, but his critics came to distrust the numbers he presented. He consistently lambasted psychoanalysis at the height of its mainstream influence but took fringe areas such as astrology, ESP, and parapsychology seriously. For much of his career, this quiet, introverted man was the public face of the discipline in Britain. Many of his books were geared to popular audiences.

Person–Environment Fit From an Organizational Psychology Perspective,"Tomoki Sekiguchi, Yunyue Yang",10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.26,"<p>Person–environment (PE) fit is broadly defined as the degree of congruence or match between a person and environment. It is relevant to various theoretical foundations, including the interactionist theory of behavior, the attraction–selection–attrition (ASA) theory, and the theory of work adjustment (TWA).

Social Cognition,Gordon B. Moskowitz,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0099,"<p>Social cognition is concerned with the study of the thought processes, both implicit and explicit, through which humans attain understanding of self, others, and their environment. Its basic assumption is that the experience of the world is constructed by the perceiver, and that the mental representations one uses for assimilating and making sense of information develop over a lifetime of experience to provide a framework for organizing incoming information, creating expectations and predictions regarding future events, and (re) processing information stored in memory. Such cognition serves (1) as the foundation for social interaction, or in the service of producing appropriate action, and (2) to allow the individual to maintain a coherent understanding/narrative of the world despite an unending stream of stimuli, new experiences, and evidence that might contradict already existing beliefs. Social cognition’s research focus spans from higher-order cognition such as reasoning, ruminating, and deliberation among options to low-order processes such as perception, attention, categorization, memory (encoding, retrieval, reconsolidation), and spreading activation among concepts in networks of associated mental representations. Typical questions focus on how affect and motivation interact with the cognitive system in shaping the type of processing engaged in and the output of that processing, thus determining what we think and feel (and ultimately how we act). In this regard there is an emphasis on the data present in the external world (e.g., whether someone is displaying anger) as an influence on behavior, and on the inherent ability of the features embedded in stimuli to capture attention and trigger specific meaning (such as what combination of facial muscles aligned in a specific way convey anger to people from all cultures). However, perhaps more importantly there is an emphasis on the subjective nature of construing such data (whether we are prepared to perceive the person as displaying anger) and on how the bias to perception and judgment that is introduced from our affect, motives, emotions, moods, values, mind-sets, and prior learning impacts what we believe we see and how the current situation is interpreted. Thus, while what one thinks about a person and what goals one adopts when interacting with that person are influenced by how one categorizes that person (which is based on attention and memory retrieval), it is also true that attention, memory, and categorization are determined by goals, context, attitudes, values, etc. Recent research has introduced concerns with dissociating the implicit from the explicit components of social cognition, as well as understanding the neural basis for cognition relating to the social world, and how this may differ from non-social cognition.</p>",2013-4-22,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0099,"Social cognition is concerned with the study of the thought processes, both implicit and explicit, through which humans attain understanding of self, others, and their environment.

The first task requires the privileging of Muslim voices, with Muslims being conceptualized as diverse, racialized peoples. The second task involves challenging the internalization of colonial ways of thinking among Muslims. The final task asks researchers and practitioners to recover Islamic histories of scholarship, Muslims’ sense of community, and queer and feminine ways of being.

Assessment takes many forms, including direct and indirect methods and summative and formative measures, and occurs across levels from the individual student to the district and state levels.

Expansive Posture,Sally D. Farley,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0267,"<p>Much can be gleaned about the affective, cognitive, and motivational states of others by attending to various channels of nonverbal communication. Although there are a variety of ways to organize the body of research on the psychological correlates of nonverbal behavior, researchers in social psychology and communication often distinguish between two dimensions: the hierarchical dimension (status/dominance/power) and the affiliative dimension (liking/romantic interest). Most nonverbal cues have implications for both of these dimensions, and postural expansion is not an exception. Postural expansion includes “enlarging” behaviors such as sitting more erectly, opening up the torso, and extending limbs away from the body. In contrast, postural constriction involves postures that ultimately make an organism appear smaller (such as slumping the shoulders, wrapping limbs around the body, or averting the gaze downward). Numerous researchers have noted the comparative similarity between postural expansion and constriction in humans and, respectively, dominance and submission displays in animals. For example, the bristling of a cat’s fur (piloerection) in response to threat serves to make the animal look larger and more threatening, while the exposure of a dog’s stomach in submission or appeasement serves to make the animal appear smaller, less threatening, or more vulnerable. Substantially more literature has investigated the association between postural expansion and the hierarchical dimension than the affiliative dimension, a bias that is duplicated here. Furthermore, it is important to note that the “hierarchical” literature addresses several related, but unique, questions: (1) How does postural expansion affect perceptions of others’ status/dominance/power? (2) Is postural expansion linked with actual differences in status/dominance/power or other relevant dependent measures?

Unconscious Processes,John F. Kihlstrom,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0228,"<p>Consciousness has to do with two aspects of mental life: monitoring ourselves, our phenomenal awareness of our experiences, thoughts, and actions; and controlling ourselves, engaging in voluntary behavior that goes beyond reflex, instinct, and conditioned response. The unconscious mind—whether it exists at all, and if so what its scope and limits are—has been an important theoretical issue since the beginning of scientific psychology. There are of course many physical and biological processes that, in some sense, proceed unconsciously: the orbiting of planets around the sun and photosynthesis are two examples. Changes in blood pressure are not accessible to phenomenal awareness; and the brain activity which gives rise to consciousness itself goes on unconsciously (neurosurgeons assure us that there is no afference in the brain). But there is little point in talking about something being unconscious if that same thing cannot also be conscious, in the sense of being accessible to phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Therefore, the adjective unconscious only makes sense when applied to mental states and mental activity, as an adjectival contrast to conscious. Mental states come in various forms—namely cognition (percepts, memories, thoughts, and knowledge acquired through learning), emotion (positive and negative feelings), and motivation (desires and goals of approach and avoidance). Usually, these mental states are accessible to consciousness, in that people are generally aware of what they are thinking, what they want and feel. “The unconscious” is shorthand for mental states and processes that are inaccessible to introspective phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. The question is whether, and to what extent, mental states can exist (and mental activities transpire) outside the scope of phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Objection: If these mental states and activities are unconscious, how are we to know them? Answer: We know them indirectly by virtue of their effects on our ongoing conscious experience, thought, and action. Question: If there are two kinds of mental states and processes, conscious and unconscious, how do they compare and contrast? Answer: In principle, unconscious processes differ from conscious processes because they operate outside phenomenal awareness. And because conscious awareness is the logical prerequisite for conscious control; unconscious processes are not susceptible to voluntary self-regulation. Other differences between conscious and unconscious processes are empirical questions.

Lineups,"Margaret Bull Kovera, Jacqueline Katzman",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0275,"<p>Lineups are conducted in the course of police investigations when a crime has been witnessed by one or more people. A lineup typically consists of a person whom the police believe committed the crime (i.e., the suspect) and some number of people who are known to be innocent of the crime (i.e., fillers). When the police have developed a suspect, they show witnesses a lineup to test whether they will claim that the suspect is the person who committed the crime (i.e., the perpetrator). If so, the witness is said to have made a positive identification of the suspect. What is not clear, at least in real-world investigations, is whether that identification is correct, because sometimes suspects are guilty and sometimes they are innocent. Since the late 1970s, psychologists have conducted experiments to find lineup procedures that decrease the likelihood that witnesses will mistakenly identify innocent suspects. These experiments are typically conducted in laboratory settings in which researchers expose participants to a simulated crime, often on videotape. After the participant-witnesses have viewed the crime, they are asked to attempt an identification from a lineup. In the laboratory, researchers can vary whether the perpetrator appears in that lineup. When the perpetrator is present in the lineup (i.e., a target-present lineup), the witness can identify the suspect (a correct identification), identify a filler, or say that the perpetrator is not there (an incorrect rejection of the lineup). When the perpetrator is not present (i.e., a target-absent lineup), the witness can make a mistaken identification of the suspect, identify a filler, or correctly reject the lineup. Using this method, researchers have identified lineup procedures that decrease mistaken identifications, which are the leading cause of wrongful convictions among those who have been exonerated by DNA tests conducted after trial. This article contains sections describing comprehensive General Overviews of research on lineups, research demonstrating that Live Lineups Are Equivalent to Photo Lineups, and Policy Recommendations and Best Practice Guidelines. The remaining sections describe many of these policy recommendations, including how Lineups Are Superior to Showups, having an Evidence-Based Suspicion for placing a suspect in a lineup, unbiased Lineup Composition, Double-Blind Administration, proper Lineup Instructions, collecting witnesses’ Confidence Statements in the accuracy of their identification immediately after the initial identification, Video Recording Identification Procedures, and avoiding Repeated Lineups.

Evolutionary Psychology as Maladapted Psychology,Robert C. Richardson,10.7551/mitpress/7464.001.0001,"A philosopher subjects the claims of evolutionary psychology to the evidential and methodological requirements of evolutionary biology, concluding that evolutionary psychology's explanations amount to speculation disguised as results.
               Human beings, like other organisms, are the products of evolution. Like other organisms, we exhibit traits that are the product of natural selection. Our psychological capacities are evolved traits as much as are our gait and posture. This much few would dispute. Evolutionary psychology goes further than this, claiming that our psychological traits—including a wide variety of traits, from mate preference and jealousy to language and reason—can be understood as specific adaptations to ancestral Pleistocene conditions. In Evolutionary Psychology as Maladapted Psychology, Robert Richardson takes a critical look at evolutionary psychology by subjecting its ambitious and controversial claims to the same sorts of methodological and evidential constraints that are broadly accepted within evolutionary biology.
               The claims of evolutionary psychology may pass muster as psychology; but what are their evolutionary credentials? Richardson considers three ways adaptive hypotheses can be evaluated, using examples from the biological literature to illustrate what sorts of evidence and methodology would be necessary to establish specific evolutionary and adaptive explanations of human psychological traits. He shows that existing explanations within evolutionary psychology fall woefully short of accepted biological standards. The theories offered by evolutionary psychologists may identify traits that are, or were, beneficial to humans. But gauged by biological standards, there is inadequate evidence: evolutionary psychologists are largely silent on the evolutionary evidence relevant to assessing their claims, including such matters as variation in ancestral populations, heritability, and the advantage offered to our ancestors. As evolutionary claims they are unsubstantiated. Evolutionary psychology, Richardson concludes, may offer a program of research, but it lacks the kind of evidence that is generally expected within evolutionary biology. It is speculation rather than sound science—and we should treat its claims with skepticism.

The Concept of Crisis in the History of Western Psychology,Martin Wieser,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.470,"<p>With roots that range from medicine to politics, to jurisdiction and historiography in ancient Greece, the concept of “crisis” played an eminent role in the founding years of Western academic psychology and continued to be relevant during its development in the 19th and 20th century. “Crisis” conveys the idea of an imminent danger of disintegration and breakdown, as well as a pivotal turning point with the chance of a new beginning. To this day, both levels of meaning are present in psychological discourses. Early diagnoses of a state of “crisis” of psychology date back to the end of the 19th century and focused on the question of the correct metaphysical foundation of psychology. During the interwar period, warnings of a disintegration of the discipline reached their first climax in German academia, when many eminent psychologists expressed their worries about the increasing fragmentation of the discipline. The rise of totalitarian systems in the 1930s brought an end to these debates, silencing the theoretical polyphony with physical violence. The 1960s saw a resurgence of “crisis literature” and the emergence of a more positive connotation of the concept in U.S.-American experimental psychology, when it was connected with Thomas Kuhn’s ideas of scientific “revolutions” and “paradigm shifts.” Since that time, psychological crisis literature has revolved around the question of unity, disunity, and the scientific status of the discipline.

Sensation Seeking,"Joseph Glicksohn, Marvin Zuckerman",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0076,"<p>Many personality traits are popular sources of research for a short time, and then, like the constructs on which they are based, they gradually fade away. In contrast, Sensation Seeking (otherwise known as Novelty Seeking, Arousal Seeking, Excitement Seeking, and other “seeking” labels) has had a steady increase in citations over the half century since the first published paper. The construct of Sensation Seeking, as developed by Marvin Zuckerman, derived from his prior research in the field of sensory or perceptual deprivation (this area of research is now referred to as “restricted environmental stimulation”). The first scale designed to predict results in these experiments on sensory deprivation was based on postulated differences in an “optimal level of stimulation,” with reference to the intensity of the stimulation. However, both these experiments and the content of the early scales showed that novelty and complexity of stimuli were also sources of motivation for the sensation seeker, and they predicted a wide range of behavioral phenomena, including volunteering, sexual behavior, relationships, smoking, drinking, drug use and abuse, risky driving, sports and other activities, vocational choices, and media, entertainment, art, and music preferences. Interest in the optimal level of stimulation and the related “optimal level of arousal” led to the first studies using psychophysiology. These studies showed a stronger reaction to novel stimuli and a greater cortical response to high-intensity stimuli in high sensation seekers, and more cortical inhibition in response to high-intensity stimuli in low sensation seekers. This latter relationship was confirmed in other species, particularly cats and rats, in which the relationship was with behavioral differences, suggestive of sensation seeking in humans. The fact that the psychophysiological marker for sensation seeking could be found in other species suggests an evolutionary origin for the trait extending back before the evolution of the human species. It also suggests a strong genetic component in the trait, confirmed in biometric twin studies. More recently, a specific dopamine receptor gene has been associated with novelty seeking in some but not all studies. In the 1970s, psychopharmacological studies showed a relationship between the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and sensation seeking.

The balance between monoamine reactivities and such conflict is hypothesized to be the biological predisposition encoded in the genes.</p>",2013-10-29,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0076,"Many personality traits are popular sources of research for a short time, and then, like the constructs on which they are based, they gradually fade away. In contrast, Sensation Seeking (otherwise known as Novelty Seeking, Arousal Seeking, Excitement Seeking, and other “seeking” labels) has had a steady increase in citations over the half century since the first published paper. The construct of Sensation Seeking, as developed by Marvin Zuckerman, derived from his prior research in the field of sensory or perceptual deprivation (this area of research is now referred to as “restricted environmental stimulation”). The first scale designed to predict results in these experiments on sensory deprivation was based on postulated differences in an “optimal level of stimulation,” with reference to the intensity of the stimulation. However, both these experiments and the content of the early scales showed that novelty and complexity of stimuli were also sources of motivation for the sensation seeker, and they predicted a wide range of behavioral phenomena, including volunteering, sexual behavior, relationships, smoking, drinking, drug use and abuse, risky driving, sports and other activities, vocational choices, and media, entertainment, art, and music preferences. Interest in the optimal level of stimulation and the related “optimal level of arousal” led to the first studies using psychophysiology. These studies showed a stronger reaction to novel stimuli and a greater cortical response to high-intensity stimuli in high sensation seekers, and more cortical inhibition in response to high-intensity stimuli in low sensation seekers. This latter relationship was confirmed in other species, particularly cats and rats, in which the relationship was with behavioral differences, suggestive of sensation seeking in humans. The fact that the psychophysiological marker for sensation seeking could be found in other species suggests an evolutionary origin for the trait extending back before the evolution of the human species. It also suggests a strong genetic component in the trait, confirmed in biometric twin studies. More recently, a specific dopamine receptor gene has been associated with novelty seeking in some but not all studies. In the 1970s, psychopharmacological studies showed a relationship between the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and sensation seeking. This finding shifted the focus of the biological theory of the trait to the monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain that are involved in approach, inhibition, and arousal—dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, respectively. Sensation seeking was postulated as being characterized by strong approach and weak inhibition (impulsivity) and arousal in approach-avoidance conflict situations.

The Effect of Brainwave Synchronization Using Binaural Beats on Improving Working Memory and Reducing the Severity of Symptoms in Women With Obsessive-compulsive Disorder,"Zahra Hodhodi, , Mehrangiz Pyvastegar, Peyman Hassani Abharian, Azam Farah Bidjari, Batool Ahadi, , , , ",10.32598/bcn.2022.4233.1,"Introduction: Binaural beats are one of the new methods of brainwave synchronization. However, there is little knowledge about its clinical applications. The positive effect of this method on executive functions, such as attention and working memory, in the γ band has been mainly confirmed in healthy individuals. Still, its effectiveness on disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with a prominent cognitive profile, has not been established. Therefore, the present study was conducted to examine the effect of binaural beats on working memory and the severity of OCD symptoms in the γ band in the affected women.a Methods: Twenty-nine OCD women aged 25-40 years referring to psychological clinics in Tehran City, Iran, were selected by convenience sampling. After completing the symptom checklist 90 (SCL90) and the Yale-Brown severity scale (SS), the participants were given the Wechsler memory scale (WMS) digit repetition subtests. Then, they were randomly assigned to the experimental (n=15) and control (n=14) groups. The audio file of the binaural beats in the γ band was provided to the experimental group.

Effect Size,David B. Flora,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0247,"<p>Simply put, effect size (ES) is the magnitude or strength of association between or among variables. Effect sizes (ESs) are commonly represented numerically (i.e., as parameters for population ESs and statistics for sample estimates of population ESs) but also may be communicated graphically. Although the word “effect” may imply that an ES quantifies the strength of a causal association (“cause and effect”), ESs are used more broadly to represent any empirical association between variables. Effect sizes serve three general purposes: research results reporting, power analysis, and meta-analysis. Even under the same research design, an ES that is appropriate for one of these purposes may not be ideal for another. Effect size can be conveyed graphically or numerically using either unstandardized metrics, which are interpreted relative to the original scales of the variables involved (e.g., the difference between two means or an unstandardized regression slope), or standardized metrics, which are interpreted in relative terms (e.g., Cohen’s d or multiple R2). Whereas unstandardized ESs and graphs illustrating ES are typically most effective for research reporting, that is, communicating the original findings of an empirical study, many standardized ES measures have been developed for use in power analysis and especially meta-analysis. Although the concept of ES is clearly fundamental to data analysis, ES reporting has been advocated as an essential complement to null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), or even as a replacement for NHST. A null hypothesis significance test involves making a dichotomous judgment about whether to reject a hypothesis that a true population effect equals zero.

This highlights growing concerns about loneliness in societies, and its deleterious effects on individual health and well-being. Loneliness or perceived social isolation is a subjective experience relating to dissatisfaction with one’s social relationships. Most research has focused on the experience of loneliness in old age, but levels of loneliness are also known to be high among teenagers and young adults. While poor health may be associated with increased feelings of loneliness, there is now considerable evidence on the role of loneliness as a risk factor for poor mental and physical health. Studies suggest that loneliness is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia and chronic diseases, and also with a higher rate of Mortality. Risky Health Behaviors, a poor cardiovascular profile, and compromised immune functioning have all been proposed as potential pathways through which loneliness may affect health.

"History of Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology in Europe","Stiliani ""Ani"" Chroni, Frank Abrahamsen",10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.135,"<p>The evolution in sport, exercise, and performance psychology in Europe goes back to the 1800s and spread from the east (Germany and Russia) to the west of the continent (France). Modern European sport psychology theorizing started with Wilhelm Wundt, who studied reaction times and mental processes in 1879, and Philippe Tissié, who wrote about psychological changes during cycling in 1894. However, Pierre de Coubertin was the one to put forward the first definition and promotion of sport psychology as a field of science. From there on, and despite obstacles and delays due to two world wars in Europe, sport psychology accelerated and caught up with North America.

However, Pierre de Coubertin was the one to put forward the first definition and promotion of sport psychology as a field of science.

Most theorists consider attitudes to be relatively enduring (i.e., they are typically not transitory like phenomena such as mood states); however, the extent to which they are stable and enduring would be expected to fall on a continuum, and is determined by factors such as variations in cognitive structure. Furthermore, many contemporary researchers suggest that a distinction can be made between attitudes that are deliberative and within an individual’s control, and those that are nondeliberative and automatic (i.e., explicit versus implicit attitudes).

It is generally acknowledged that psychological tests, along with the existing conceptualizations of measurements of human potentials, are among the most-valuable contributions of behavioral sciences to society.

Because of their latent nature, they are typically measured indirectly, that is, by registering behavior on appropriate tasks or responses to test items. Psychological testing is regarded as the process of measuring human attributes by procedures designed to obtain a sample of behavior. The meaning of assessment is broader to some extent and includes gathering and integration of test-related data, and those from other sources, to make an evaluation, professional decision, or recommendation about a person. Within more than a century of testing and assessment practice, different conceptual frameworks have been proposed and have served as a foundation of psychological test development, including the methods for evaluation of their usefulness and quality.

Homeric Psychology,Joel P. Christensen,10.7591/cornell/9781501752346.003.0002,"<p>This chapter presents the author's view of psychology in Homer. It begins by suggesting that the <italic>Odyssey</italic> is particularly interested in a central psychological issue — agency — and that it demands that its audience consider issues of agency and responsibility throughout its plot.

Psychoneuroimmunology,"Michelle A. Chen, Christopher P. Fagundes",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0303,"<p>The field of psychoneuroimmunology is concerned with how psychological factors “get under the skin” to impact the nervous system and immune system. Using observational longitudinal and experimental methods, researchers in the field of psychoneuroimmunology have found that psychological factors can dysregulate the immune system, the central and peripheral nervous system, and the endocrine system in ways that influence wound healing, latent herpesvirus reactivation, vaccine responses, susceptibility to viruses, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., production of proteins that signal immune cells that promote inflammation). Specifically, neurotransmitters and hormones regulate immune cells, which in turn have vast clinical implications on health and immunity. Theories and methods within psychoneuroimmunology have been utilized to investigate a wide array of physical health problems from asthma to cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Interpersonal stressors appear to have a particularly significant impact on these systems in comparison to non-interpersonal stressors. Furthermore, stressors that occur early in life may have a lasting effect on the immune system, the endocrine system, and the nervous system into adulthood and old age. The field has become increasingly focused on how the immune system can impact mood and behavior. Indeed, certain types of depression and fatigue appear to be affected by dysregulated immunity. Emerging areas of investigation include a focus on interactions between the brain, gut, mitochondria, and diet. Finally, there is great interest in understanding how epigenetic processes (i.e., how genes are expressed) emerge from life experiences, impacting immunity and disease.</p>",2023-1-12,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0303,"The field of psychoneuroimmunology is concerned with how psychological factors “get under the skin” to impact the nervous system and immune system.

Disgust,"Daniel Linford, Mallory Parker, Daniel Kelly",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0251,"<p>Research on disgust connects to a surprisingly large variety of topics across the behavioral sciences and humanities. It serves as a case study in debates about the nature of emotions themselves, their relationship to cognition and affect, whether and how much they might be innately constrained or socially constructed, which parts might be universal (and uniquely) human, and which can vary across cultures and eras, malleable in the face of diverse social influences. These questions have been addressed by researchers using a number of approaches. Developmental psychologists have been piecing together the typical ontogenetic trajectory of disgust, the emergence of its different components during childhood and adolescence, and its progression from being mostly concerned with brute physical food- and body-based cues to becoming increasingly alert to and involved in social dynamics. Evolutionarily oriented researchers have sought to identify the primary and secondary functions of disgust, the biological and cultural adaptive challenges they were selected to help solve, and the character of the facial expressions that help transmit information relevant to solving them. As always, research on brain function as well as typical patterns of dysfunction, breakdown, and involvement with mental disorder sheds light on all of these questions. Much research has focused on investigating the variety of domains in which disgust appears to operate, ranging from food regulation to disease avoidance to sexual activity and mate selection. Researchers continue to debate the differences and similarities between episodes of disgust that are provoked by elicitors from each these different domains. Disgust operates in the moral and aesthetic domains as well, imbuing a class of norms with its singular phenomenology and motivational force, the effects and implications of which have been investigated and debated by psychologists, anthropologists, and philosophers. Some argue that disgust does and should play important roles in Morality, moral judgment, and moral justification. Others are skeptical, arguing that ideally disgust would be completely absent from morality, and that we should aspire to minimize its role in moral judgments and social institutions. Another form of skepticism takes issue with the descriptive claims and empirical evidence itself, questioning whether the effects of disgust on moral judgment are as large and systematic as asserted, with some questioning whether what appears to be influencing moral judgments is genuinely disgust at all, or whether talk of ‘moral disgust’ is merely metaphorical. These areas of research are connected to recent work on disgust and politics, and how a person’s political orientation relates to disgust sensitivity, norm cognition, and their conception of the content and boundaries of the moral domain. Aestheticians have also taken an interest in disgust and the way artists have used it to evoke characteristic response in their audiences.</p>",2019-9-25,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0251,"Research on disgust connects to a surprisingly large variety of topics across the behavioral sciences and humanities.

He also made major contributions to that sub-discipline referred to at the time as “child” psychology, and laid the foundations for a comprehensive system of thought that he would name “critical personalism.” After relocating to Hamburg in 1916, Stern continued his scholarly efforts in these domains, taught courses both in psychology and in philosophy at the university that opened its doors there in 1919, and played major administrative roles there in the institutional homes of both disciplines until forced to flee Nazi Germany in 1934. The present chapter highlights ways in which, over the course of his scholarly career, Stern boldly opposed certain trends within mainstream thinking that were ascendant during his time."

"Religion, Psychology, and Science: Steps toward a Wider Psychology of Religion",Allan R. Andrews,10.1177/009164717900700105,"The psychology of religion historically has defined itself with great difficulty, and general psychologists have been reluctant to investigate religious phenomena. General or introductory psychology textbooks, which play a “gate-keeping” role for the discipline of psychology, typically disregard any systematic study of the psychology of religion, as is shown in a small, informal sample of these textbooks. The problem of definition not only plagues the psychology of religion because religion is so elusive a phenomenon; it also exists in mainstream psychology, where a clear definition of the field has been controversial since the formal beginnings of the discipline in the late nineteenth century. It is suggested that the problems of definition in both religion and psychology can be traced to the endemic definition of science. In psychology, science is often narrowly defined and aligned exclusively with experimental methodology. Introductory textbooks are strong in their implications of this narrow view of science, often to the point of dismissing or diminishing religious ways of knowing.

Transformative-Activist and Social Justice Approaches to the History of Psychology,Anna Stetsenko,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.466,"<p>The history of psychology is characterized by unparalleled complexity of its methodology and uniquely ambiguous subject matter closely entangled with issues of power, social justice, and ethics.

Psychology and Epigenetics,Frank Masterpasqua,10.1037/a0016301,"The Human Genome Project mapped the complete DNA sequence that exists in each human cell, but questions remain about how genes are expressed. Epigenetics is defined as mechanisms of gene expression that can be maintained across cell divisions, and thus the life of the organism, without changing the DNA sequence. Recent research has identified important epigenetic mechanisms that play essential roles in normal and abnormal development.

Transpersonal psychology as critical/radical psychology,Elliot Cohen,10.53841/bpstran.2022.24.1.24,"Editor’s note: this article is a summary of the Keynote at the Section Annual Conference Transpersonal Activism on 12 September 2021.Despite its designation as the ‘Fourth Force,’ Transpersonal Psychology often occupies a peripheral and precarious place within mainstream Psychological approaches. Its historic focus on mystical/spiritual and non-ordinary states of consciousness, coupled with its continued emphasis on subjective and experiential inquiry, have often led to it being excluded in favour of more materialist, positivistic paradigms that currently dominate the discipline. Rather than attempt to simply adapt and assimilate into more mainstream, conventional forms of Psychology, Transpersonal Psychology has a unique opportunity to actively embrace its otherness and outsider status; to pursue authentic interdisciplinary encounters and pioneer more inclusive and radical approaches to research methods. In contemporary Humanistic and Engaged expressions of Eastern Wisdom Traditions (specifically Hinduism, Buddhism and Daoism) one may observe the increasing emphasis on ecological awareness, recovery of the Divine Feminine and more spiritually informed approaches to social justice. To avoid accusations of remoteness, solipsism and spiritual bypassing, Transpersonal Psychologists also need to better attend and creatively respond to prevailing political and socioeconomic conditions.

For some ideas ""validity depends upon belief."" Bateson is not a believer in American individualism; he loves such terms as form, order, and pattern. His learning theory rests centrally on the changing of contexts rather than the mere acquisition of data.

Unfortunately, so long as we use their concept of the world, we will be fighting a losing battle. Bateson believes in both deductive and inductive science: the inductive is the acquisition of data, but our very way of perceiving data comes from deductive views of life, even though this is denied by many empiricists.

Self-compassion and Social Anxiety Symptoms: Fear of Negative Evaluation and Shame as Mediators,", Fatemeh Sadrzadeh, Ahmad Borjali, , Zohreh Rafezi, ",10.32598/jpcp.12.4.967.1,"Objective: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) can negatively impact various aspects of life, incurring significant personal and societal costs. Thus, it is necessary to identify protective factors that buffer against SAD symptoms and the mechanisms underlying their mitigation. This research aims to examine the relationship between self-compassion and social anxiety symptoms among university students, specifically exploring the potential mediating effects of fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and shame. Methods: This study examined the relationships between variables through structural equation modeling (SEM) using a correlational design. The sample included 242 undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral students from Tehran’s public universities, selected via the convenience sampling method. Social phobia inventory, the self-compassion scale, the brief form of FNE scale, and the shame subscale of self-conscious affect questionnaire were used to collect data. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation via SPSS software, version 22, and SEM using AMOS software, version 22.

Ageism at Work,Amy Pytlovany,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0261,"<p>A demographic shift has been occurring in the workforce and is expected to continue in most industrialized nations across the globe. The popular press calls it “the graying of the workforce,” or “the silver tsunami,” reflecting a trend of an aging workforce. Older employees are remaining at their jobs longer and consequently age diversity within organizations has increased. Five different generations (Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z) are working together more than ever before. Increased age diversity has important implications for organizational processes and can have positive and negative consequences. As this trend continues, businesses must adapt to effectively manage age-diverse employees. If left unchecked, ageism at work can lead to numerous detrimental outcomes for organizations (e.g., reduced firm performance, employee turnover), teams (e.g., intergroup conflict), and individuals (e.g., selection discrimination, poor health). Research on this topic seeks to understand the content and process of age-based stereotyping, accuracy of stereotypes, outcomes of age bias, and conditions under which stereotypes are most likely to result in discrimination.

Terror Management Theory,Sheldon Solomon,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0058,"<p>Terror management theory posits that the juxtaposition of an inclination toward self-preservation with the highly developed intellectual abilities that make humans aware of their vulnerabilities and inevitable death creates the potential for paralyzing terror.

This is accomplished primarily through the cultural mechanism of self-esteem, which consists of the belief that one is a valuable contributor to a meaningful universe, and hence eligible for literal and/or symbolic immortality. Effective terror management requires, first, faith in a meaningful conception of reality (the cultural worldview), and second, belief that one is meeting the standards of value prescribed by that worldview (self-esteem).

Hegemony and Marxist Psychology,Ronald Mather,10.1177/09593543030134002,"Recently there have been several attempts to arrive at a more precise understanding of the relationship between Marxism and psychology. These have been notable in that they have been informed by Althusserian treatments of Marxism rather than orthodox Freudian or Lacanian themes. Such treatments, it is argued, entail the complete eradication of any notion of subjectivity. The following analyses the Gramscian concept of hegemony and whether it can furnish an alternative to this rejection and provide at least an initial point of departure in formulating a `Marxist psychology'. It suggests that hegemony is a dialectical concept in the classical Hegelian tradition, a concept expressible only in and through the Hegelian notion of a `speculative proposition'. It is argued that this would necessitate a wholesale rejection of the classical Marxist tradition that assigns primacy to the material base. No grounds for causal primacy can be adduced from a truly dialectical relationship. It is suggested that the `logic' of hegemony is fundamentally at odds with hegemony as an item of real socio-cultural analysis. Gramsci's own retention of the primacy thesis, the dominance of the economic moment in the constitution of hegemony, requires that hegemony be the result of that moment as a causal factor.

Engendering Culture in Psychology,Erica Burman,10.1177/0959354305054750,"This paper explores the politics of gender circulating within the discourse of culture in psychology. Two complementary conceptualizations of culture are considered in relation to the politics of gender representation they either afford or disallow. Notions of dominant or mainstream culture typically portray gender as marginal or else as indicative of other markers of difference (whereby the over-visibility of gender reflects its tokenized, reified and homogenized status). Either way, both the centrality and intersectionality of gender and culture are overlooked in ways that bolster the liberal pluralism of multiculturalist discourse. Alternatively, discourses around culture that presume minority status currently function to indicate racialized difference. These not only reify cultural practices in ways that abstract and separate them from the contexts of their emergence and function and so feed into discourses of cultural pathologization, but they also privilege ‘race’ over gender and so, paradoxically, marginalize and even exclude some minority women’s positions, interests and experiences. Within both discourses of culture, the contemporary romanticization and abstraction surrounding notions of ‘community’ is shown to marginalize gender-specific issues posed by the position of minoritization. Drawing on conceptual-political problems posed by prevailing discourses of culture and gender in relation to domestic violence, some examples are offered to indicate how re-conceptualizing the relations between culture, ‘race’ and gender can challenge and change theory, policy and practice.",2005-8,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354305054750,"This paper explores the politics of gender circulating within the discourse of culture in psychology.

To understand the dynamic development of HR management, the research literature has identified two distinctive but complementary trends: convergence and divergence. The convergence trend predicts the emergence of universal HR systems due to gradually homogenous economic systems caused by the continuous progress of industrialization and technology. By contrast, the divergence trend anticipates the coexistence of multiple distinct HR systems resulting from insurmountable barriers of institutional contexts.

This study aimed to predict distress tolerance, impulsivity, and aggression based on emotional dysregulation and reward sensitivity among individuals with BPD features. Methods: The study population was undergraduate students of Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran City, Iran, in the academic year 2017-18. A total of 1005 male and female students were chosen based on the available sampling method and were screened according to the personality assessment inventory-borderline scale. Finally, 146 subjects (50 males and 96 females) could reach the second phase of the research, and all of them completed the difficulties in emotion regulation scale, distress tolerance scale, Balloon analog risk task as well as aggression questionnaire. To analyze the data, we used multivariate regression analysis.

Learning Theory,"Mark E. Bouton, Geoffrey Hall",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0252,"<p>For over a century, psychologists have been conducting experimental studies, largely with nonhuman animals, in order to establish general principles of learning and behavior. In everyday usage, the term “learning” refers to the acquisition of new information or new skills. But psychologists often have a wider interpretation, taking learning to refer to almost any fairly permanent change in an animal’s behavior, or potential for behavior, that results from experience. Learning is the process whereby an animal interacts with its environment and becomes changed by the experience so that its further behavior is modified. “Learning theory” refers to the attempt to devise an account of the mechanisms responsible for this process of individual adaptation. The data it deals with are largely, but not exclusively, derived from experimental studies of the behavior of nonhuman animals, tested in controlled conditions. The last century, starting with the pioneering work of Pavlov (on classical conditioning) and of Thorndike (on instrumental learning), saw the development of a range of rival learning theories that are still of present-day concern. The dominant theoretical perspective may be termed associative (or alternatively, connectionist); it explains learning in terms of the formation of hypothetical links (presumed to be in the central nervous system) between entities representing external events or responsible for the emission of behavior. This central notion has been extended by theorists who emphasize the role of motivational factors that activate such links, or who postulate a wider range of psychological processes (conveniently labeled cognitive: e.g., attention, rehearsal), with association formation given a lesser role. Finally, some have rejected not just the notion of association but all postulation of central psychological processes. This atheoretical “theory,” referred to as radical behaviorism or the experimental analysis of behavior, is primarily associated with the name of Skinner and focuses on instrumental learning (also called operant conditioning). Although learning theories have been derived principally from work on laboratory animals, they are intended to be applicable more generally. Their findings and concepts are relevant to understanding the psychology of domestic and wild animals in their natural habitats and thus contribute to the growing field of research known as animal cognition. They also apply to the behavior of our own species. Experimental studies of human subjects, based on paradigms developed with animals, can thus be used to test and develop our theories. More important, the methods and findings of learning theory have direct application to issues of human concern. Proponents of the experimental analysis of behavior have promoted the use of training procedures involving positive reinforcement for addressing a number of behavior disorders and as the basis for education more generally. Theoretical concepts developed in the associative tradition have been used to illuminate the source of (and possible treatments for) clinical problems such as anxiety disorders and drug addiction.</p>",2019-10-30,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0252,"For over a century, psychologists have been conducting experimental studies, largely with nonhuman animals, in order to establish general principles of learning and behavior.

Exploratory Data Analysis,Chong Ho Yu,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0200,"<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a strategy of data analysis that emphasizes maintaining an open mind to alternative possibilities. EDA is a philosophy or an attitude about how data analysis should be carried out, rather than being a fixed set of techniques. It is difficult to obtain a clear-cut answer from “messy” human phenomena, and thus the exploratory character of EDA is very suitable to psychological research. This research tradition was founded by John Tukey, who often relates EDA to detective work. In EDA, the role of the researcher is to explore the data in as many ways as possible until a plausible “story” emerges. A detective does not collect just any information. Instead, he or she collects clues related to the central question of the case. By the same token, EDA is not “fishing” or “torturing” the data set until it confesses. Rather, it is a systematic way to investigate relevant information from multiple perspectives. Tukey emphasizes the role of data analysis in research, rather than mathematics, statistics, and probability. Mathematics is secondary in the sense that it is a tool for understanding the data. Classical statistics aims to infer from the sample to the population based on the probability as the relative frequency in the long run. However, in many stages of inquiry, the working questions are non-probabilistic and the focal point should be the data at hand rather than the probabilistic inference in the long run. Hence, prematurely adopting a specific statistical model would hinder the researchers from considering different possible solutions. Because EDA endorses open-mindedness and triangulation, it is not a standalone approach. Rather, it complements traditional confirmatory data analysis (CDA) by generating a working hypothesis, as well as spotting outliers and assumption violations that might invalidate CDA. Additionally, it can also be operated with Bayesian statistics and resampling side by side. With the advent of high-power computers and voluminous data, many exploratory techniques have been developed in data science. These methods are known as data mining. Because it is tedious or even impossible to detect the data patterns when the sample size is extremely large or there are too many variables (this problem is called the “curse of dimensionality”), some data miners use machine learning to explore alternate routes for understanding the data. There are different taxonomies of EDA. Traditionally, EDA comprises residual analysis, data re-expression, resistant procedures, and data visualization.

The Insanity Defense,Michael J. Vitacco,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0318,"<p>The insanity defense is a legal standard that deals with determining culpability for criminal acts. When met, it absolves the individual of a criminal act they committed, although they are typically mandated to a secure hospital for treatment. As defined in federal jurisdictions under 18 U.S.C. §17(a), insanity “is an affirmative defense under any Federal Statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant as a result of severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.” The presence of a mental disease or defect is considered a threshold condition, meaning it first must be determined if a mental disease or defect exists, and then determined if that condition was severe enough to cause the individual to be unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of their acts. Some states have added a volitional component to their insanity defense. This prong deals with if an individual, as the result of a threshold condition, lacks the substantial capacity to conform their conduct to the law. However, it must be noted that the insanity defense is unpopular with many state legislatures. Four states (Idaho, Kansas, Montana, and Utah) have abolished the insanity defense. Forensic psychiatrists and psychologists are often tasked with conducting these retrospective evaluations. This is a difficult task, as it requires the forensic practitioner to reconstruct an individual’s mental state as it relates to the alleged criminal act days, months, or even years after the event. To conduct these evaluations properly often requires a substantial amount of collateral information, including previous mental health records, academic records, employment records, and, most recently, information gleaned from social media, that can assist the evaluator in the reconstruction of an individual’s mental state.

L’un des objectifs pour la psychologie du counseling au Canada est de rendre la psychologie disponible à un large éventail de la population par de nombreux moyens. L’Association Internationale de Psychologie Appliquée peut travailler à accroître cette aire d’application et prendre le Canada comme modèle pour développer ce champ dans d’autres pays.Counselling psychology in Canada was examined using a SWOT analysis. Four strengths were identified: identity, paradigm, skill set, and education and training. Tensions within the first three of these strengths were also considered weaknesses. External opportunities for counselling psychology included changes in society, social diversity, and health. Among the threats to counselling psychology in Canada are the university context for training programmes, competition with other professional groups, and pressure from external influences on how to define counselling psychology practice. The vision for the future of counselling psychology in Canada is based on the principle of making psychology available to a wide range of the Canadian population through a variety of means. The International Association of Applied Psychology can work to enhance this area of professional psychology and can look to Canada for support and models in developing this field in other countries."

"Cortisol, Family Coping and Burden in Informal Caregivers of Addicts",", António Soares, M. Graça Pereira, ",10.56769/ijpn01106,"Abstract  This study focuses on the prospective mediation role of family coping between burden and cortisol levels in informal caregivers of addicts as well as on the feasible use of two different ways to analyse the salivary cortisol levels. Participants were 120 Portuguese informal caregivers of addicts. The cortisol samples were collected at awakening, 45 minutes later and after a 30 minute presentation of images taken from the International Affective Picture System.  Family coping and caregiver burden were measured using the Portuguese versions of the Caregiver Reaction Assessment, and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scale. Cortisol samples were collected in salivettes and the results were computed in order to determine the Area Under the Curve scores (AUCg, AUCi). Results found family coping to be negatively correlated with burden and AUCg levels (i.e. overall intensity) and  positively correlated with either AUCg and AUCi  (i.e. change over time). The mediation model revealed that family coping was a partial mediator in the relationship between the burden and AUCg levels.  Therefore, Family Coping appears to be an essential variable in understanding the stress response and should be considered in further studies and interventions. In addition, the use of two different formulas for calculating cortisol levels provided important new information concerning the relationship between cortisol, burden and family coping. It seems that burden has a more profound effect on the overall intensity of the neuroendocrine response to caregiver stress and not so much on the sensitivity of the system.

Nature and Nurture as an Enduring Tension in the History of Psychology,Hunter Honeycutt,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.518,"<p>Nature–nurture is a dichotomous way of thinking about the origins of human (and animal) behavior and development, where “nature” refers to native, inborn, causal factors that function independently of, or prior to, the experiences (“nurture”) of the organism. In psychology during the 19th century, nature-nurture debates were voiced in the language of instinct versus learning. In the first decades of the 20th century, it was widely assumed that that humans and animals entered the world with a fixed set of inborn instincts. But in the 1920s and again in the 1950s, the validity of instinct as a scientific construct was challenged on conceptual and empirical grounds. As a result, most psychologists abandoned using the term instinct but they did not abandon the validity of distinguishing between nature versus nurture. In place of instinct, many psychologists made a semantic shift to using terms like innate knowledge, biological maturation, and/or hereditary/genetic effects on development, all of which extend well into the 21st century. Still, for some psychologists, the earlier critiques of the instinct concept remain just as relevant to these more modern usages.</p>

Those who only know of social psychology know not social psychology: A tribute to Gustav Jahoda’s historical approach,Michael Billig,10.1177/1354067x18779042,"This article examines Gustav Jahoda’s late work, focussing on his historical writings which have tended to be somewhat overlooked. In many respects this later work, which needs to be understood as a whole, parallels his earlier work into culture. In his later writings, Jahoda wrote about the history of social psychology but his history served a critical purpose: he was arguing that social psychology was essentially historical. If behaviour was primarily determined by culture then culture was itself historical and, in this regard, social psychological relations were, thus, historical. Because social psychologists need to think historically, as well as culturally, Jahoda considered that it was important that they should not be constrained by artificial disciplinary boundaries. Jahoda’s advocacy of non-disciplinary thinking was not confined to social psychologists. Just as social psychologists should think historically, so sometimes historians need to think social psychologically. As such, C.L.R.

Conclusions. The developed training program can be used for training women who work in state and commercial organizations and/or are members of public organizations."
"Maslow's ""Transhumanism"": Was Transpersonal Psychology Conceived as ""A Psychology without People in it""?",Mark E. Koltko-Rivera,10.1177/00221678980381007,"What we may call the transhuman/inhuman critique states that transpersonal psychology is centered on cosmic issues rather than on human ones and so is not a human psychology at all. Abraham Maslow's statements to the effect that the transpersonal is ""transhuman, centered in the cosmos rather than in human needs"" are considered evidence of this position. Analysis of Maslow's lesser known writings indicates that Maslow, somewhat like J. Huxley, used ""transhuman"" to indicate the essentially human capacity to desire universal values like justice and truth over the satisfaction of purely personal needs. Thus, the transhuman/inhuman critique is based on a misreading of Maslow. The transpersonal is not inherently unpsychological or divorced from human concerns; rather, it represents an extension of psychology's vision of the human.",1998-1,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/00221678980381007,"What we may call the transhuman/inhuman critique states that transpersonal psychology is centered on cosmic issues rather than on human ones and so is not a human psychology at all.

Global psychology,John W Berry,10.1177/0081246313504517,"The study of psychology has been largely developed in Europe and the United States. It thus has close ties to the cultural traditions of those particular societies. As a result, the discipline and practice of psychology are largely culture-bound, limited in its origins, concepts, and empirical findings to only this small portion of the world. The discipline is also culture-blind, largely ignoring the influence of the role of culture in shaping the development and display of human behaviour. The result has been the dominating position of a Western Academic Scientific Psychology in relation to other cultural perspectives. Challenges to, and some possible solutions for, these problems have come from some recent regional and national conferences. In particular, the Nassau Declaration from the Caribbean Regional Conference of Psychology in 2011 and the Capetown Declaration from the International Congress of Psychology in 2012 have highlighted widespread concern for this continuing imbalance in international psychology.

Toward a cogenetic cultural psychology,Luca Tateo,10.1177/1354067x16645297,"The dialogue between cultural psychology and phenomenological and semiotic philosophy seems to be extremely promising.

Semiotic approaches show how humans, as meaning-making beings, experience the world in the form of totalities that emerge from primary distinctions in the continuum of experience. First, drawing on cogenetic logic, I argue that any epistemological model that aims to account for developmental processes must emerge from a triadic system, rather than following the procedures of a binary logic, in order to have any correspondence between concept building and phenomenological world in psychology.

While sustained, large-scale conflicts are truly awful, in that they cause horror but also astonishment, they arise from the normal, mundane processes underlying intergroup dynamics.

A Critical Psychology of the Postcolonial,Derek Hook,10.1177/0959354305054748,"Of the theoretical resources typically taken as the underlying foundations of critical social psychology, elements, typically, each of Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, one particular mode of critique remains notably absent: postcolonial theory.

One answer is that of a reciprocal form of critique, the retrieval of a ‘psychopolitics’ in which not only is the psychological placed within the register of the political, but—perhaps more challengingly—the political is also, strategically, approached through the register of the psychological. What the writings of Fanon and Biko make plain in this connection is the degree to which the narratives and concepts of the social psychological may be reformulated so as to fashion a novel discourse of resistance, one that opens up new avenues for critique for critical psychology, on the one hand, and that affords an innovative set of opportunities for the psychological investigation of the vicissitudes of the postcolonial, on the other.",2005-8,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354305054748,"Of the theoretical resources typically taken as the underlying foundations of critical social psychology, elements, typically, each of Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, one particular mode of critique remains notably absent: postcolonial theory.

Moreover, the social constructionist perspective exemplified so well in these volumes is problematized.

The History of Psychological Psychotherapy in Germany: The Rise of Psychology in Mental Health Care and the Emergence of Clinical Psychology During the 20th Century,Lisa Malich,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.628,"<p>Two different but related developments played an important role in the history of psychologists in the fields of mental health care in Germany during the 20th century. The first development took place in the field of applied psychology, which saw psychological professionals perform mental testing, engage in counseling and increasingly, in psychotherapy in practical contexts. This process slowly began in the first decades of the 20th century and included approaches from different schools of psychotherapy. The second relevant development was the emergence of clinical psychology as an academic sub-discipline of psychology. Having become institutionalized in psychology departments at German universities during the 1960s and 1970s, clinical psychology often defines itself as a natural science and almost exclusively focuses on cognitive-behavioral approaches. There are four phases of the growing relationship between psychology and psychotherapy in Germany in which the two developments were increasingly linked: first, the entry of psychology into psychiatric and psychotherapeutic fields from approximately 1900 until 1945; second, the rise of psychological psychotherapy and the emergence of clinical psychology after World War II until 1972, when the diploma-regulations in West Germany were revised; third, a phase of consolidation and diversification from 1973 until the pivotal psychotherapy law of 1999; and fourth, the shifting equilibrium as established profession and discipline up to the reform of the psychotherapy law in 2019.

Establishing Embodiment in Psychology,Edward E. Sampson,10.1177/0959354396064004,"The dominant discourse within the western tradition and within the psychology it has spawned can be described as exclusionary: history, culture and community are generally not considered as central to understanding what are presumed to be universal psychological processes. Although the challenger and possible successor to the dominant tradition's discourses, social constructionism, is inclusive of history, culture and community, it shares with the dominant tradition an exclusion of embodiment. Other than the object-body (i.e. the body that a third person observer can know), which remains of interest both to the dominant tradition and to social constructionism's examination of how discourse constructs this object-body, neither the dominant nor the successor discourse deals with the inherently embodied character of all social practices, including discursive practices themselves. All exclusions, including the exclusion of embodiment, have serious political ramifications.

Moral Conviction,"Lindsay Keeran, Linda J. Skitka",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0274,"<p>Moral conviction refers to the perception that one’s feelings about a given attitude object are based on one’s beliefs about right and wrong. Holding an attitude with moral conviction means that a person has attached moral significance to it. Some people hold an attitude based on their likes and dislikes, or their preferences. Other attitudes may be based more on norms and conventions in a society, such as what the law dictates or what close others believe. Still other attitudes are based on people’s beliefs about right and wrong, and thus are attitudes held with moral conviction. Unlike some of the other dominant ways of conceptualizing morality in moral psychology, research on moral conviction takes a bottom-up approach. Instead of assuming certain issues are moral, individuals are asked to evaluate different attitude objects and issues based on their beliefs about right and wrong with questions like, “To what extent is your position on X connected to your beliefs about fundamental right and wrong?” Attitudes held with strong moral conviction, also called “moral mandates,” have a number of important characteristics and consequences that set them apart from other strong, but nonmoral, attitudes. When an attitude is based on one’s sense of right and wrong, it is perceived to be more of an objective fact (e.g., it is the correct and factual position to have) that should be universally held. Morally convicted attitudes have a stronger emotional intensity than equally strong but nonmoral attitudes. These attitudes are more likely to have a motivational component to them, so people act in favor of their moral attitudes because they provide justification for the action and are seen as obligations. Moral convictions can also provide an internal guide for behavior, independent of authority or group influence (i.e., authority independence). Moral mandates have a variety of consequences, which can be seen in either a normatively positive or negative light. Moral conviction is, for example, associated with increased political engagement and volunteerism (generally seen as normative goods), but also predicts increased intolerance and unwillingness to compromise with those who do not share one’s moral point of view (generally seen as normative bads).</p>",2021-2-24,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0274,"Moral conviction refers to the perception that one’s feelings about a given attitude object are based on one’s beliefs about right and wrong.

Trait Perspective,"M. Brent Donnellan, Christopher Hopwood",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0060,"<p>Personality traits, or relatively enduring and global patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving, are thought to be a foundational element of personality by many researchers. Gordon Allport is widely recognized as the founder of academic personality psychology, and his perspectives on the trait concept continue to be influential today. Following Allport, many contemporary trait psychologists theorize that traits are rooted in biological processes but shaped by life experiences. Moreover, contemporary trait psychologists believe personality traits have causal implications, meaning that they affect how individuals interpret and respond to the challenges of life as well as the responses that individuals evoke from others. To be sure, personality traits work together and in concert with situational factors to generate behavior, which is an idea with a long history in psychology. Despite the popularity of trait concepts in lay theories of human behavior, the existence and importance of personality traits has been a controversial topic in academic psychology. The goal of this bibliography is to introduce readers to the trait concept and to the debates surrounding personality traits by providing references to both classic and contemporary readings. The first sections (see General Overviews) provide references that give an overview of personality traits, cover issues in the concept of Defining Traits, and discuss the role of personality traits in the broader field of personality psychology. These introductory sections are followed by an overview of The Person-Situation Debate, a critical conflict in the history of trait psychology. We refer to classic readings in this debate and cover Responses to the Person-Situation Debate. These reactions to the person-situation debate have come to define, in part, how modern trait psychologists view their field. Trait psychology is often strongly identified with personality assessment; thus the next section in this bibliography covers issues in Assessing Personality Traits including measurement validity, reliability, and the utility of various measurement methods. Improvements in assessment have led to one of the major accomplishments in trait psychology: the delineation of a common structure for higher order personality traits in the form of the “Big Five” domains (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability or neuroticism, and openness). The next section includes readings on Evaluating the Structure of Personality Traits and includes papers from both proponents and critics of the Big Five/five-factor models. A major accomplishment following the person-situation debate was a more precise articulation of the developmental course, biological correlates, and impacts of traits for understanding adaptation across the lifespan.

Anxiety Disorders,"Jeannette M. Reid, Dean McKay",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0006,"<p>Recent epidemiological research has shown that anxiety disorders, collectively, are the most common set of psychiatric disorders. Lifetime prevalence estimates suggest that nearly 30 percent of the population will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their life (Kessler, et al. 2005, cited under Phobias). Bolstering the concern, anxiety disorders (as a group) tend to be associated with a host of cognitive impairments (e.g., perseveration, visual memory deficits), diminished quality of life (e.g., in areas of work and social functioning), and both psychiatric and medical comorbidities. Anxiety disorders may be roughly classed into two groups: (1) those characterized primarily by acute fear (e.g., phobias) and (2) those associated with lower level, but chronic, anxiety and apprehension (with the clearest example being generalized anxiety disorder). Cognitive and behavioral explanations of anxiety predominate, with related treatments showing most consistent research support among psychosocial interventions. (While standard pharmacological practices are mentioned wherever relevant, a more in-depth discussion of pharmacological interventions for anxiety disorders is outside the scope of this chapter.) In general, the etiology of anxiety disorders is likely best understood through the lens of the diathesis-stress model—such that individuals have a genetic predisposition/vulnerability and situational factors mediate symptomatology. (Certainly, a sudden expression of symptoms following brain damage would be an exception. However, as these presentations—albeit fascinating—are in the minority, a related discussion will be beyond the scope of this bibliography.)

These studies include: psychological problems in research techniques, such as interview bias, bias in questions, the effect on answers caused by the ordering of options and questions; application to marketing research of such projective methods as sentence completion tests, word association, cartoon tests, guess tests, thematic apperception tests and so on; panel surveys, motivation research, subliminal perception, etc. With the progress of operations research, econometrics, psychometrics and so on quantitative analysis has become more detailed and subtle. In spite of this, problems and phenomena have arisen which could not be comprehended or analysed solely on the quantitative level, and the necessity for qualitative analysis not depending on quantitative analysis resulted in the increased use of such methods as the depth interview and the group interview. Theoretical studies include those on consumer behaviour, measurement of advertising effectiveness, cultural influence on consumer behaviour, image and image formation, purchasing attitude and purchasing behaviour, value and price."

Rethinking Psychology and Rethinking `New-ness',Mike Michael,10.1177/0959354398083010,"This review essay, in addition to presenting a general overview of the three volumes, interrogates their claims to being contributions to the `new paradigm' in social psychology. Firstly, it is noted that the political dimension of the `crisis' critiques of orthodox experimental social psychology is largely absent from these volumes. This is particularly reflected in the fact that some of post-crisis developments-for example, those drawing on the work of Michel Foucault-do not feature in the version of the `new paradigm' presented here. Moreover, the social constructionist perspective exemplified so well in these volumes is problematized. Drawing on the sociology of the environment, it is suggested that an `even newer new paradigm' is in the process of emerging in which constructionism and realism are held in tension or ambivalence. Some of the implications of this ambivalence for new paradigm social psychology are explored.",1998-6,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354398083010,"This review essay, in addition to presenting a general overview of the three volumes, interrogates their claims to being contributions to the `new paradigm' in social psychology.

Knowledge and Practice in Critical Psychology,Ute Osterkamp,10.1177/0959354309103538,"This article outlines the essential characteristics of a psychology from the subject standpoint that starts from the principal unity of self-determination and determining the relations that determine one's own actions.

In contrast to standard research, where one attempts to grasp the dependency of the individual agency of others on societal structures and their cultural meanings, psychology from a subject standpoint is about relating to the societability of one's own actions, that is, analysing them to grasp their own real preconditions and implications. Consequently, in such a subject science perspective, the aim is less to gain or disseminate knowledge and more to analyse the many ways in which “critical” knowledge urging change is ignored or modified to make it compatible with one's own actual possibilities to act.

Some Postmodern Reflections on Social Psychology,Mike Michael,10.1177/0959354391012004,"This paper tentatively identifies a conceptual axis that, despite their fundamental differences, is common to both cognitivist social psychology and social constructionist social psychology.

This emphasizes, for example, the possibility of change for individuals and social collectivities. In contrast, it is suggested that operating within cognitive and social constructionist social psychologies is the conceptual axis: stabilization-clarification-practicality.

A Critical Psychology of the Postcolonial,Derek Hook,10.1177/0959354305054748,"Of the theoretical resources typically taken as the underlying foundations of critical social psychology, elements, typically, each of Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, one particular mode of critique remains notably absent: postcolonial theory. What might be the most crucial contributions that postcolonial critique can make to the project of critical psychology? One answer is that of a reciprocal form of critique, the retrieval of a ‘psychopolitics’ in which not only is the psychological placed within the register of the political, but—perhaps more challengingly—the political is also, strategically, approached through the register of the psychological. What the writings of Fanon and Biko make plain in this connection is the degree to which the narratives and concepts of the social psychological may be reformulated so as to fashion a novel discourse of resistance, one that opens up new avenues for critique for critical psychology, on the one hand, and that affords an innovative set of opportunities for the psychological investigation of the vicissitudes of the postcolonial, on the other.",2005-8,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354305054748,"Of the theoretical resources typically taken as the underlying foundations of critical social psychology, elements, typically, each of Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, one particular mode of critique remains notably absent: postcolonial theory.

Life-Span Development,Kathleen Stassen Berger,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0079,"<p>Life-span development studies human development from the moment of conception to the last breath.

Life-span science is relatively new, flourishing since about 1970 as a distinct area in psychology, but it has deep roots in developmental research on children and the elderly. The concept that early family experiences affect later life is implicit in a century of child-rearing research, especially from a psychoanalytic or behavioral perspective, and the idea that genes affect all of life, including intelligence and personality, has been central to the biological understanding of human life for decades. Life-span development acknowledges these genetic and early family influences but also holds that culture, cohort, and contexts are powerful. A basic tenet is that change is always possible: people are affected but not determined by their genes and early childhood.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate the mediating role of using technology in cognitive flexibility, social participation and purpose in life in achieving successful aging.
Methods and Materials: The research design of this study is descriptive-correlational study. A number of 409 elderly people over 60 years participated by convenience sampling method and based on the inclusion criteria. Data was collected through the Successful Aging Scale (SAS), Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), the Social Participation Scale, the Purpose in Life Scale, and the Technology Questionnaire. The data was analyzed using a path analysis correlation test using a bootstrapping method using AMOS 26 software.
Findings: In this study, 53.5% of the participants were men and 46.5% were women, of whom 44.7% were between 60 and 65 years old and 3.7% were over 81 years old. The results showed that all the indicators of the model are in the optimal range and the model has a good fit with the data.

Somatoform Disorders,"Karl Julian Looper, Laurence J. Kirmayer",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0106,"<p>Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified.

Affirmative Action,"Elif G. Ikizer, John F. Dovidio",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0324,"<p>Affirmative action refers to laws or government-mandated or voluntary policies or procedures designed to promote the equitable inclusion of members of certain historically excluded groups by granting members of these groups additional consideration for educational, economic, and employment opportunities. Affirmative action has traditionally been one of the structural ways to promote diversity in society. While much of the research on affirmative action has focused on the United States, affirmative action programs exist in many other countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. The approaches used internationally vary in many ways, most commonly with respect to the groups that the programs are designed to benefit and the degree to which group-based characteristics are considered in relation to other, merit-based credentials. For example, whereas the use of quotas in affirmative action is prohibited in the United States, affirmative action programs for college admission and federal employment in Brazil and India employ quotas for people of color. In 2023, India passed a law to reserve 33 percent of state and national legislative positions for women. India’s affirmative action policy, in which a person’s nationality, sex, religion, and caste are taken into account in education and employment by public and private organizations, is grounded in the country’s constitutional principles. Also, different countries justify having affirmative action policies to varying degrees by the goals of remediating past injustice, improving economics, promoting diversity, and achieving social justice. Who affirmative action benefits, how the policy is justified, how affirmative action programs are implemented, and the attitudes and ideologies of people viewing the program all contribute to the extent to which affirmative action is supported or opposed by people. While considering affirmative action internationally, this examination focuses on affirmative action in the United States, which has stimulated significant behavioral science research and generated considerable public controversy, in order to illuminate basic processes that shape the content and consequences of affirmative action. Support and opposition to affirmative action may both be grounded in principles of justice, but these are sometimes competing values. Specifically, this entry considers (a) a range of resources examining multiple facets of the topic, (b) assessments of the effectiveness of affirmative action, (c) reactions based on self- or group-interest, (d) individual differences in responses to affirmative action, (e) impact of the way the program is justified on support, (f) psychological consequences, (g) dynamics of help in relation to affirmative action, and (h) recent developments for promoting diversity.</p>",2024-2-20,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0324,"Affirmative action refers to laws or government-mandated or voluntary policies or procedures designed to promote the equitable inclusion of members of certain historically excluded groups by granting members of these groups additional consideration for educational, economic, and employment opportunities.

Why Moral Psychology Needs Personality Psychology,"Jessie Sun, Luke D. Smillie",10.31234/osf.io/azek6,"<p>People vary in how they perceive, think about, and respond to moral issues. Clearly, we cannot fully understand the psychology of morality without accounting for individual differences in moral functioning. But decades of neglect of and explicit skepticism toward such individual differences has resulted in a lack of integration between moral psychology and personality psychology—the study of psychological differences between people.

Broadening Political Psychology,"Peter K.

Yet that is precisely where we are today. The genetics and neurobiological revolution is upon us, and we advocate that political psychology not simply join this revolution but take a lead role in it. Here in this review, we explore the various ways in which political psychology can embrace this revolution and incorporate work in neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychiatry, endocrinology, and recent advances in genetics. In doing so, we advocate the adoption of an epidemiological approach and discuss the ways in which various methods including physiological experimentation, genetic analysis, and neurological explorations including MRIs and other technical advances provide critical insight into human behavior and present intriguing possibilities for exploring the nature of political attitudes, attachments, and behaviors. In advocating for broadening the approaches used in the field, we reflect critically on how we might improve and strengthen the accuracy of our understanding of the psychological bases of political preferences and behavior in the future.",2012-2,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00867.x,"One hundred years ago, if we proposed that we could make you happy with a pill, we would have been ridiculed and would have entered the realm of science fiction and not science itself.

An Ecological Approach to Psychology,Harry Heft,10.1037/a0032928,"Even though the term “ecology” was introduced into scientific discourse in the 1860s, and by century's end much of experimental psychology had embraced an evolutionary perspective, it took more than another half century before proposals for an ecological psychology began to appear. Even so, ecological psychology was marginalized from the mainstream of the discipline, and it remains so today. This disjunction between psychology's embrace of evolutionary theory and its resistance to ecological thinking can be explained, in large part, historically. It was Herbert Spencer's evolutionary framework, that assumes an environment-mind dichotomy, which was embraced by most early psychologists, and its influence remains today. A Darwinian perspective, in contrast, stresses the activity of an organism in the context of the dynamic mutual relations of its econiche. At the heart of Darwinian thinking, and in turn ecological psychology, are dynamic organism-environment relations, functionally meaningful environmental properties, as well as change and variation. An ecological psychology also recognizes that humans, like other living things, adapt to their econiche, in part, by altering it and thereby modifying the econiche's functional properties. The human econiche, in particular, is characterized by functionally significant, socially normative meanings owing to the sociocultural systems that naturally stem from the character of hominid evolution.",2013-6,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0032928,"Even though the term “ecology” was introduced into scientific discourse in the 1860s, and by century's end much of experimental psychology had embraced an evolutionary perspective, it took more than another half century before proposals for an ecological psychology began to appear.

The Conditions of Possibility of Critical Psychology,Gordana Jovanović,10.1177/0959354310367469,"I argue for an approach to critical psychology that is strongly foundationalist and radically anti-fundamentalist. By laying foundations for psychology in the historical and social conditions of its subject matter, the paper works against the psychological fundamentalism that has become a remarkable feature of postmodern societies. The general framework for my approach is that of modernity understood as a project of self-foundation. Within the modernity project, critique was developed in two forms: as reconstruction (of conditions) and as criticism (of constraints). The foundational approach to critical psychology combines both forms of critique. Reconstructing the conditions of possibility of its subject matter in social and therefore necessarily hermeneutic terms, it avoids the fundamentalist temptations of psychologism.

Can Psychology Help Reduce the Risk of Nuclear War?,James G. Blight,10.1177/0022167888282002,"Nuclear psychology, which began with the very best of intentions is, according to this article, doomed to failure and perpetual irrelevance unless it begins to take what the author refers to as a phenomenological approach to the subject. So far, too much attention has been given to ""off-the-shelf' models derived from the psychological clinic and laboratory, and too little attention has been given to the actual perspective of nuclear policy makers, who are the people psychologists must influence if they hope to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear war. The author attributes this trend to positivism, the belief that psychology is a natural science rather than one of the humanities. In his view, if psychologists wish to reduce nuclear risks, they must get more fully inside the viewpoints of policymakers, they must assume policymakers' roles at least in their imaginations, and only then will they come up with proposals that will make sense to the policy-making community. There are two requirements: (1) to obtain a greater understanding of what policymakers' thoughts and feelings are about during nuclear crises-those episodes when nuclear risks have been greatest, and (2) to know what it actually is like to have such thoughts and feelings at moments when the fate of the world is believed to be at stake. Importantly, this leads, or ought to lead, psychologists to the study of the Cuban missile crisis, the closest call by far to nuclear war between the superpowers. There is a great deal to be learned about the psychological reality of that moment of maximum nuclear danger in October, 1962. The author illustrates his argument with a literary metaphor drawn from John LeCarre 's The Little Drummer Girl.  ""She's panicked,"" Litvak announced suddenly to Becker's back.

"The Mediating Role of the Use of technology in the Relationship Between Cognitive Flexibility, Social Participation, Purpose in Life, and Successful Aging",", Pantea Mousavi, Abdolaziz Aflakseir, , Mohammadali Goodarzi, , Mohammadreza Taghavi, ",10.32598/sija.2025.3958.1,"Objectives: In recent years, with an increase in the rate of aging around the world, the concept of successful aging and its related factors have been considered. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the mediating role of using technology in cognitive flexibility, social participation and purpose in life in achieving successful aging.
Methods and Materials: The research design of this study is descriptive-correlational study. A number of 409 elderly people over 60 years participated by convenience sampling method and based on the inclusion criteria. Data was collected through the Successful Aging Scale (SAS), Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), the Social Participation Scale, the Purpose in Life Scale, and the Technology Questionnaire. The data was analyzed using a path analysis correlation test using a bootstrapping method using AMOS 26 software.
Findings: In this study, 53.5% of the participants were men and 46.5% were women, of whom 44.7% were between 60 and 65 years old and 3.7% were over 81 years old. The results showed that all the indicators of the model are in the optimal range and the model has a good fit with the data. The indicators of CFI=0.96, GFI=0.93, NFI=0.90 and RMSEA=0.075 have been reported. Also, the obtained results showed that all the obtained correlation coefficients were significant at the level of p&lt;0.05 or p&lt;0.01.

Developing the Identity-based Psychodrama Package and Comparing It With Psychodrama on Neuroticism,", Amir Zolali, Seyed Hamid Atashpour, , Ilnaz Sajjadian, ",10.32598/jpcp.10.3.830.1,"Objective: Most studies have focused only on the neuroticism superstructure and the reduction of its symptoms, while there is no comprehensive model on the treatment of neuroticism infrastructurally. This research aimed to develop an identity-based psychodrama package and compare the effect of this therapy with psychodrama on neuroticism. Methods: This research consists of five studies. The first study was qualitative research with Attride-Stirling’s thematic analysis method. The research community in this stage for analyzing themes affecting identity achievement included all papers related to identity aspects. The second study was a qualitative content analysis based on an inductive approach through a semi-structured interview with neurotic individuals. The third study was a quantitative analysis, and an educational-therapeutic package was developed. The fourth study was of validation type with Lawshe’s method. The population in this stage included all specialized psychologists in identity issues. The last study was a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest type with a control group and a follow-up period of 60 days. The population in this stage included all people referred to Pendar Nik Counseling Center in Najafabad City, Isfahan Province, Iran, in 2020. Finally, 60 people were selected and randomly assigned into 2 experimental groups and 1 control group. To collect data, the 5-factor inventory was used. Results: The first study’s results suggested 8 general themes, and with additional information in the second study, the identity-based psychodrama package was developed in the third study. The results of the fourth study indicated the validity of the package by the evaluators.

This research aimed to develop an identity-based psychodrama package and compare the effect of this therapy with psychodrama on neuroticism. Methods: This research consists of five studies. The first study was qualitative research with Attride-Stirling’s thematic analysis method. The research community in this stage for analyzing themes affecting identity achievement included all papers related to identity aspects. The second study was a qualitative content analysis based on an inductive approach through a semi-structured interview with neurotic individuals. The third study was a quantitative analysis, and an educational-therapeutic package was developed. The fourth study was of validation type with Lawshe’s method. The population in this stage included all specialized psychologists in identity issues. The last study was a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest type with a control group and a follow-up period of 60 days. The population in this stage included all people referred to Pendar Nik Counseling Center in Najafabad City, Isfahan Province, Iran, in 2020. Finally, 60 people were selected and randomly assigned into 2 experimental groups and 1 control group. To collect data, the 5-factor inventory was used. Results: The first study’s results suggested 8 general themes, and with additional information in the second study, the identity-based psychodrama package was developed in the third study. The results of the fourth study indicated the validity of the package by the evaluators. The results of the previous study showed that the mean scores of neuroticism in the two experimental groups significantly differed from the control group scores. Besides, identity-based psychodrama was more effective in reducing neuroticism than psychodrama (P<0.001).

Practical Psychology for Policing,Jason Roach,10.1332/policypress/9781447325918.001.0001,"<p>As contemporary policing becomes ever more complex, so knowledge of practical psychology becomes ever more important in everyday policing encounters, situations, and contexts.

Further reading is signposted for those wanting to know more about certain topics, theories, and concepts. This book provides examples of how psychological research has informed policing (and vice versa) and suggests how new ways of applying psychological knowledge and research can be of benefit to a range of policing contexts; for example, beat patrols, preventing crime, and using the Self-Selection Policing approach to uncover serious criminality from less serious offences. Looking forward, it is suggested how psychological knowledge, research, and policing might evolve together, to meet the changing challenges faced by contemporary policing.

Factor Analysis,"Ronald D. Porter, Leandre R.

Emerging Challenges for Theory and Psychology,Kenneth J. Gergen,10.1177/0959354391011002,"With the waning of empiricist foundationalism, theoretical commitments become a focus of critical concern. For psychologists, the post-empiricist shift presents challenges of immense scope and significance for future inquiry. For purposes of centering further dialogue, this article outlines five major challenges for a theoretically sophisticated psychology. First, because concepts of knowledge rest on assumptions about human functioning, psychologists should take an active role in exploring successors to empiricism. Realism and constructionism are among the most prominent candidates; others remain for critical contrast and comparison. Second, attention is invited to the cultural contexts favoring or inimical to various theoretical standpoints.

For psychologists, the post-empiricist shift presents challenges of immense scope and significance for future inquiry. For purposes of centering further dialogue, this article outlines five major challenges for a theoretically sophisticated psychology. First, because concepts of knowledge rest on assumptions about human functioning, psychologists should take an active role in exploring successors to empiricism. Realism and constructionism are among the most prominent candidates; others remain for critical contrast and comparison. Second, attention is invited to the cultural contexts favoring or inimical to various theoretical standpoints.

Heidegger and the Subject,Paul Stenner,10.1177/0959354398081004,"This paper extracts key themes from Heidegger's philosophy and critically applies them to issues of relevance to psychology. A case is made that Heidegger's arguments concerning ontology before the subject/object distinction, his discussion of enframing, his concern with the understanding of being, and his distinction between modes of being are all important for a rethinking of psychological practice. Heidegger's contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics and existentialism are discussed and clarified in terms of distinctions between truth and correctness, the ontological and the ontic, and Being and beings. The conclusion points psychology towards a `deep reflexivity'.",1998-2,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354398081004,"This paper extracts key themes from Heidegger's philosophy and critically applies them to issues of relevance to psychology.

Personal Reflections on Theory and Psychology,Gerd Gigerenzer,10.1177/0959354310378184,"Psychology’s most important task is to integrate the various extant patchworks of theories into overarching theories. Theory integration is a longstanding concern in biology, economics, or physics, but not in psychology. We teach our students how to test theories, not the art of theory construction in the first place. As a consequence, in some parts of psychology, theories have become replaced by surrogates, such as circular restatements of the phenomenon, one-word explanations, and lists of general dichotomies. Moving backwards from existing models to labels is an odd event in science, which typically progresses in the opposite direction. Theory construction should be taught in graduate school, and editors of major journals should encourage submissions that make advances in theory integration.",2010-12,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354310378184,"Psychology’s most important task is to integrate the various extant patchworks of theories into overarching theories.

Remembering,Hartmut Blank,10.1027/1864-9335.40.3.164,"There is increasing awareness that memory is embedded in social context and subject to social influence, with little concomitant theoretical integration of memory and social psychological thinking. Following a brief classification of social memory phenomena, I attempt such an integration through an extended conception of memory retrieval – inspired by social psychological theorizing – that describes the conversion of accessed memory information into memory beliefs (validation stage) and further into memory statements (communication stage). Both stages draw on external context, including social influence: Broadly, informational influence shapes memory beliefs, and normative influence memory statements.

The modularity debate in evolutionary psychology,"Dan Chiappe, Ricca Gardner",10.1177/0959354311398703,"The adherence of evolutionary psychology (EP) to the massive modularity thesis has generated considerable controversy. Barrett and Kurzban argue that much of the debate is misplaced because critics have incorrectly characterized the sense of modularity involved in EP. They offer an account centered on “functional specialization,” an emphasis on formal properties of representations, and an eschewing of references to content domains. We argue that their concept of modularity is at odds with the claims made by EP advocates. Indeed, their definition of modularity is so broad that it includes mechanisms traditionally rejected by EP. Furthermore, their concept of modularity has limited usefulness in explaining the existence of mechanisms designed to deal with novel challenges and with the development of novel solutions to longstanding adaptive problems.

Lacking an understanding of a real reference point outside the self, humanistic psychology tended to divinize the self and its higher values, minimizing as it did so the infrahuman and societal conditions of the self.

Political Psychology as Discipline and Resource,Adela Garzón Pérez,10.1111/0162-895x.00243,"Around the 1960s, political psychology was developed as a field of knowledge that attempted to interrelate scientific psychology and political phenomena. However, social and academic conditions are very different today. More and more, political psychology is becoming a protagonist, as much in the internal context of psychology as in the external context of its relations with the social world. Thus, political psychology can now be seen as a resource relating psychological knowledge to social practice, and relating psychological processes to social action. Political psychology is the interface that puts psychology and society in contact. The development of political psychology in Spain provides an example of this alternative view of the field.",2001-6,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/0162-895x.00243,"Around the 1960s, political psychology was developed as a field of knowledge that attempted to interrelate scientific psychology and political phenomena.

The central idea of conflict management is that organizations can improve in the way conflict is managed by accepting conflict as part of organizational dynamics and by learning to deal with it effectively and efficiently. Given the ubiquity of conflict, it is perhaps unsurprising that the study of its management and resolution has become a popular topic in the last decades, particularly in the fields of management, human resources, and psychology. The aim of this article is to cover current topics in the area of conflict management in the workplace. To do so, the article is divided into different sections. In the different sections of the article, the reader will find academic sources on conflict and conflict behavior, types of conflict in the workplace at different levels, such as interpersonal, team, and intergroup, and a variety of resolution strategies, particularly negotiation and mediation, covering interventions by supervisors, colleagues, and (internal and external) third parties. Further, studies on the link between diversity, culture, and conflict, mistreatment in the workplace, and conflict in specific contexts, such as family business or start-ups, are presented. This article concludes with a collection of works on conflict management systems and tools to measure and evaluate conflict behavior in organizations. The sections included were chosen given the relevance from an academic point of view as well as from a practitioner perspective, where these aspects all are inevitable parts of the understanding of organizational conflict at different levels of complexity, and from understanding these conflicts and the conflict behavior to third parties. Complexity also adds in specific types, as harassment and bullying, often related to diversity and inclusion in organizations, and in specific contexts, as start-ups or family businesses, both rapidly growing fields of academic interest and of high importance to the global economy.

Belief Perseverance,"Corey L. Guenther, Abigail M.

In fact, this propensity to develop, maintain, and unwaveringly cling to one’s beliefs in the absence of sufficient evidence is one of the most well-established tendencies in the social-psychological canon. It is a tendency that contributes to numerous psychological effects, including those involved in impression formation, comparative bias, attitude persuasion, intergroup perception, and social judgment, to name a few. And just as importantly, this tendency also has significant implications for judgment and decision-making in critical applied domains, including politics, jury deliberation, and medicine. The area of research that most directly illustrates this tendency is that on belief perseverance. Initially documented in the 1960s, belief perseverance refers to the tendency to maintain held beliefs even when the evidence supporting such beliefs is fully invalidated. It is the most extreme manifestation of espousing attitudes or belief systems in the absence of objective support—they are not merely beliefs based on evidence that is difficult to muster or verify, but rather, they are beliefs that persist despite their very evidential foundation being fully discredited as factually false.

The book examines how particular class identities shape youth narratives about globalization and “Indianness” generally, as well as specific stories about self and identity, social inequality, dignity, poverty, family, relationships, work, marriage, and practices of consumption.

Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,Daniel David,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0147,"<p>Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) is the first form of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and was created by Albert Ellis. REBT theory is based on the ABC model, where A stands for activating events, B for beliefs, and C for various psychological outcomes. Based on REBT, psychological outcomes are not generated by A (the activating events), but by how one cognitively processes them. Rational beliefs refer to beliefs that have logical, empirical, and/or pragmatic support; in interaction with various A, they produce functional psychological consequences. Irrational beliefs refer to beliefs that do not have logical, empirical, and/or pragmatic support; in interaction with A, they generate dysfunctional psychological consequences. REBT theory is a motivational theory, part of the appraisal paradigm. Our desires/goals can be formulated rationally and/or irrationally. Some people formulate their desires/goals rigidly (e.g., “I must be loved by my wife and cannot accept if this does not happen”), with demandingness/DEM as a primary irrational appraisal. When DEM is not confirmed by A, secondary irrational appraisal mechanisms follow: (1) frustration intolerance/FI (e.g., “I cannot stand if what I think should happen doesn’t happen”); (2) awfulizing/catastrophizing/AWF (e.g., “It is awful if what I think should happen doesn’t happen”); and (3) global evaluation in the form of self-downing (e.g., GE/SD: “I am worthless if my wife does not love me as she should”), other downing (e.g., GE/OD: “My wife is damnable because she does not love me as she should”), and/or life downing (e.g., GE/LD: “Life is totally bad if my wife does not love me as she should”). The combination of primary and secondary irrational appraisals generates dysfunctional negative feelings, maladaptive behaviors, and/or unhealthy psychophysiological reactions. If DEM is confirmed by A, we experience dysfunctional positive feelings. Other people formulate their desires/goals flexibly, involving motivational relevance, flexibility, and acceptance (e.g., “I want to be loved by my wife, but this does not have to happen, and I am doing my best to be loved, but I accept that sometimes things do not happen the way I want them to happen”). When this flexible belief (i.e., preference/PRE) is not confirmed by A, secondary rational appraisal mechanisms follow: (1) frustration tolerance (e.g., FT: “I can stand if what I think should happen doesn’t happen even though it is a struggle for me to do so and I can still enjoy other things”); (2) non-awfulizing/nuanced evaluation of badness (e.g., BAD: “It is bad if what I think should happen doesn’t happen, but it is not awful and I can still try to enjoy other things”); and (3) unconditional acceptance in the form of self-acceptance (e.g., USA: “I accept myself unconditionally even if my wife does not love me”), other-acceptance (e.g., UOA: “I accept my wife as a human being even if she does not love me”), and/or life-acceptance (ULA: “Life is not totally bad if my wife does not love me”). The combination of primary and secondary rational appraisal mechanisms generates functional negative feelings, adaptive behaviors, and healthy psychophysiological reactions. If PRE are confirmed by A, we experience functional positive feelings. Once generated by the ABC process, a C (e.g., primary anxiety) can become a new A’ and thus a new ABC cycle begins, where B (e.g., “It is awful to be anxious”) represents meta-beliefs and C (i.e., anxiety about anxiety) represents secondary emotions/meta-emotions.</p>",2014-1-30,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0147,"Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) is the first form of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and was created by Albert Ellis.

Can psychology learn from the natural sciences?,Gerd Gigerenzer,10.1177/09593543231209342,"I argue that psychology can learn from the natural sciences and focus on the weight that physics attributes to precise theories. Much of psychology can be increasingly characterized by theory aversion—yet not the kind motivated by positivism. Theory aversion in psychology arises from a conflict between two desires: to come up with a theory, and to avoid the necessary mental effort and time as well as the risk of refutation. The results are ersatz theories, or surrogates. I outline three common, but independent, research practices that avoid building precise theories of psychological processes: the null ritual, which allows researchers to get away with not specifying their research hypothesis; as-if theories, which refrain from modeling psychological processes; and lists of binary oppositions, as in dual-system theories, which consist of vague dichotomies.

Psychology of Narrative Art,"Keith Oatley, Maja Djikic",10.1037/gpr0000113,"Artistic narrative has been recognized in fictional genres such as poetry, plays, novels, short stories, and films. It occurs also in nonfictional genres such as essays and biographies. We review evidence on the empirical exploration of effects of narrative, principally fiction, on how it enables people to become more empathetic, on how foregrounded phrases encourage readers to recognize the significance of events as if for the first time in ways that tend to elicit emotion, and on how literary works can help people to change their own personalities.

Restoring the Human in Humanistic Psychology,Andrew Garrison,10.1177/0022167801414006,"Positivistic psychologies marginalize transcendent human values by reducing them to by-products of naturalistic mechanisms. One result is a depersonalized and depersonalizing psychology. Humanistic psychology reasserted transcendental values and made them the central motives of its theory of human behavior. However, humanistic psychology shared the core secularizing assumptions of positivism in locating transcending values as “inner” impulses and instincts rather than as experiences of real participation in the transcendent order toward which they aimed. Lacking an understanding of a real reference point outside the self, humanistic psychology tended to divinize the self and its higher values, minimizing as it did so the infrahuman and societal conditions of the self.

We argue that their concept of modularity is at odds with the claims made by EP advocates. Indeed, their definition of modularity is so broad that it includes mechanisms traditionally rejected by EP.

Psychology is a thoroughly modern discipline which rests upon the fantasy of observing behaviour directly. Recently, however, postmodern debates in the discipline have drawn attention to the construction of behaviour and experience in language organized through discourse.

Positive Psychology,"Dana Becker, Jeanne Marecek",10.1177/0959354308093397,"Positive psychology has figured itself as no less than a revolutionary reorientation of psychology, one that makes individual `flourishing' the primary object of study and intervention.

We argue for a focus beyond the individual in isolation, a perspective that takes in the totality of the social environment and an ethical stance that values social engagement and activism.

Psychological Perspectives on Metaphor,Brian Bowdle,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0244,"<p>Metaphors are commonly defined as figures of speech in which one thing is described in terms of another thing that is notably different. For example, in the metaphor love is a rose, the target term love refers to a human emotion, whereas the source term rose refers to a flowering plant. Metaphor is classified as a type of figurative language (along with idioms, irony, metonymy, and several other forms), and until fairly recently, it was assumed that metaphors and other figures of speech were relatively unimportant aspects of communication. However, it is now recognized that metaphor is pervasive in everyday language, and a growing number of researchers and theorists now view metaphor more as an aspect of thought than of language. Indeed, metaphor has been shown to be involved in knowledge acquisition, conceptual change, abstract reasoning, social persuasion, and even the development of empathy between individuals and groups. It is hardly surprising, then, that metaphor now occupies a central place in many areas of research on cognition and communication. This article begins by listing a number of introductory volumes, anthologies, and journals devoted to metaphor and related forms of figurative language. Next, a lengthy section on theoretical approaches to metaphor processing traces the evolution of different perspectives on the nature of metaphor and discusses a range of important theories and key research studies.

Personality Disorders,"Edelyn Verona, Sean McKinley, M. Sima Finy",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0082,"<p>Personality disorders (PDs) are defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013) as “an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and leads to distress or impairment” (p. 645). Although broad in scope, this definition is meant to distinguish PDs from other psychological disorders that are less clearly related to enduring personality. Indeed, as of 1980, in DSM-III, PDs were introduced in a different “axis” from other disorders, such as mood or anxiety disorders, ensuring that clinicians pay attention to acute disorders as well as personality-based problems in living. The former were classified under Axis I, or “Clinical Disorders,” representing acute manifestations of illness (e.g., schizophrenia, panic disorder), whereas PDs were classified under Axis II (along with mental retardation) in order to capture inflexible personality traits that have become problematic and that require psychological attention. However, with the publication of DSM-5, the multi-axial system has been eliminated in favor of a general scheme that places all disorders (clinical and personality) on the same diagnostic plane. In DSM-5, ten distinct PDs are listed, organized into three clusters: odd or eccentric (paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal); dramatic, emotional, or erratic (antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, histrionic); and anxious or fearful (avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, dependent) disorders. Individuals who show broad dysfunctions in personality that warrant treatment but who do not meet criteria for any specific PD are often classified as “Unspecified Disorder,” which is not in itself a personality disorder, but instead used to enhance specificity of an existing disorder or as a means of attaching a diagnosis to an individual for treatment purposes. Furthermore, a dimensional model of personality disorder, in which symptoms would be identified on a gradient scale of severity rather than a diagnostic checklist, was proposed during the DSM-5 revision process; however, this model was not approved to replace the categorical schema and was instead placed in section III of the manual (entitled “Emerging measures and models”). As of the early 21st century the etiology for PDs is unclear and multidetermined, but specific temperamental (e.g., neuroticism, disinhibition), environmental (e.g., childhood abuse), and biological (e.g., prefrontal cognitive control systems) factors have been most implicated.

Psychological Perspectives on Metaphor,Brian Bowdle,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0244,"<p>Metaphors are commonly defined as figures of speech in which one thing is described in terms of another thing that is notably different. For example, in the metaphor love is a rose, the target term love refers to a human emotion, whereas the source term rose refers to a flowering plant. Metaphor is classified as a type of figurative language (along with idioms, irony, metonymy, and several other forms), and until fairly recently, it was assumed that metaphors and other figures of speech were relatively unimportant aspects of communication. However, it is now recognized that metaphor is pervasive in everyday language, and a growing number of researchers and theorists now view metaphor more as an aspect of thought than of language. Indeed, metaphor has been shown to be involved in knowledge acquisition, conceptual change, abstract reasoning, social persuasion, and even the development of empathy between individuals and groups. It is hardly surprising, then, that metaphor now occupies a central place in many areas of research on cognition and communication. This article begins by listing a number of introductory volumes, anthologies, and journals devoted to metaphor and related forms of figurative language. Next, a lengthy section on theoretical approaches to metaphor processing traces the evolution of different perspectives on the nature of metaphor and discusses a range of important theories and key research studies.

Attitudinal Ambivalence,"Nicoletta Cavazza, Vincent Pillaud, Fabrizio Butera",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0254,"<p>Research on attitudinal ambivalence started in the early 1970s, forty years after the first wave of research on attitudes. Ambivalent attitudes consist of both positive and negative evaluations of the same object. Early approaches proposed different measurement methods, and ambivalence can now be measured either directly (referred to as “felt ambivalence”) or indirectly (referred to as “potential ambivalence”). Because of its duality, ambivalence has been studied in comparison with univalent attitudes—which consist of either positive or negative evaluations of an object—to uncover their specific features, antecedents, and consequences. Relevant research has focused on identifying the prevalence of ambivalent attitudes, and on whether they could stem from particular personality traits or situations. Researchers have found that ambivalent attitudes seem to be widespread and can be held for a long period of time. Their relationship with behaviors has also been widely studied. At the individual level, ambivalence increases response latency when a choice has to be made, extends information processing, can affect attitude stability, and can even lead to discomfort. At the behavioral level, studies have highlighted the moderating role of attitudinal ambivalence on the relationship between attitudes and behavior. A different field of research focuses on its strength to question whether ambivalence leads to more resistance or susceptibility to persuasion and influence. It appears that ambivalent attitudes are pliable and, depending on the context, can either help individuals to be more adaptive or prevent them from arriving at a satisfying conclusion. The role of ambivalent attitudes in interpersonal relationships and self-presentation also highlight some benefits in holding an ambivalent attitude. This article opens by reviewing general overviews to provide a detailed picture of the current state of research. It then presents early approaches to attitudinal ambivalence, and reviews studies that highlight the moderating role of attitudinal ambivalence on the relationship between attitudes and behavior, as well as studies that question whether ambivalence might lead to more resistance or susceptibility to persuasion and influence.

Psychology: Is It Applied Enough?,Pieter J.D. Drenth,10.1111/j.1464-0597.2008.00337.x,"The question “Is psychology applied enough?” can be regarded in two ways.

Secondly, it could refer to the question whether psychology is utilised enough in dealing with the great many pressing problems in modern society. And it is shown that this question cannot be answered in the affirmative.

First, it is important to note just how widespread have been psychologists' misunderstandings of positions and arguments in the philosophy of science, and what this says about the disciplinary isolation of psychology. Secondly, despite some common misunderstandings amongst qualitative researchers in psychology, there are good reasons for psychologists to resist both the quantitative imperative and the positivists' overly narrow construal of philosophy of science. These reasons relate to important, non-quantifiable characteristics of many psychological phenomena.

The Psychology of Satanic Worship,Gavin Ivey,10.1177/008124639302300404,"A significant amount of media attention has recently been focused on allegations of widespread Satanic activity in South Africa. However, little social scientific research has been forthcoming on the nature, incidence, activities, and psychological dynamics associated with Satanism. In this article I attempt to address this lacuna by examining the definition, history, social context, and ideology of Satanism. ‘Satanism is defined as a specific religious cult, characterized by the inversion of Christian norms and ideology. It is argued that the apparent increase in Satanic activity is related to a socio-economic context of radical cultural change, turmoil, and social instability. Contemporary white adolescents, feeling alienated, anxious, and powerless, are attracted to Satanism as a means of obtaining magical power and control over their destiny. Satanism, in addition, meets specific psychological needs which are not met by other forms of religious worship. In the article I consider the psychological factors which predispose individuals to Satanic activities, and concludes by examining the diagnostic status of demonic possession in clinical psychology.",1993-12,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/008124639302300404,"A significant amount of media attention has recently been focused on allegations of widespread Satanic activity in South Africa.

Reading in the Undergraduate Psychology Curriculum,Faye B. Steuer,10.1207/s15328023top2304_4,"Scholars express concern about college students' declining reading levels when the need for critical literacy is growing. Burner's (1985, 1986) theory of two basic modes of thought—narrative and paradigmatic—offers a scheme for categorizing reading assignments. The scientific nature of psychology requires students to read paradigmatic text critically. Empirical evidence suggests that differences among students' reading abilities are related to general ability, domain knowledge, decoding ability, working memory, and study techniques. Task variables (e.g., being required to create analogies or summaries and style or syntax of textual materials themselves) are also important.

"Times, Theories and Practices in Social Psychology",Mark Levine,10.1177/0959354303013001762,"This paper begins by problematizing the `taken for granted' status of Newtonian linear time at the heart of (social) psychology.

To demonstrate this approach, it considers some of the multiple times that are relevant for analysing the concept of `identity'. It also explores the multiple times of the research encounter.

Self-formulation in counselling psychology: The Power Threat Meaning Framework,Nicola Amari,10.1177/00221678231154292,"This reflective report critically evaluates my developing professional identity as a counseling psychologist. Using the Power Threat Meaning Framework, I present a self-formulation to make sense of my experiences during the second stage of my training. To begin with, I consider how multiple forms of power were operating in the complex relationship between personal and professional spheres. As I appraise my professional development, I examine the threats posed by the negative use of power and the resulting challenges within my practice. Drawing from research, psychological theories, and relevant case examples, I explore the meaning I attached to my experiences while managing complex problems and professional issues.

Repopulating the Depopulated Pages of Social Psychology,Michael Billig,10.1177/0959354394043001,"The author of this academic article writes about the way that psychology, especially social psychology, is written in academic journals.

Several rhetorical devices are outlined: for instance, `variable vagueness' in describing subjects, unmarked expressions for describing group differences, and the routine absence of individual data. These rhetorical devices are not discussed as methodological defects, but as means for accomplishing depopulation. The result of these conventional practices of writing is that psychologists tend to produce general descriptions which are not instantiated in particular cases.

"Psychology as Mental Health Practice in the United States, 1945–1980","Wade E. Pickren, Ingrid G. Farreras",10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.640,"<p>In a relatively brief period of time, the discipline of psychology in the United States changed from being mostly concerned with its status as a legitimate science, qua physics or biology, to a rapidly growing field caught up in the tensions between academic science and the practice of psychology as a mental health profession. The numerical growth of the field’s members was heavily concentrated in the professional areas of mental health application. This was due primarily to the changed conditions of postwar life and the concerns of policymakers about the mental health of citizens in a dynamic, fast-changing, and fast-paced society. Government funding for psychology dramatically increased, especially funds for training clinical psychologists and for conducting research on mental health problems. It was not long before many of the clinical psychologists moved away from solely academic work and into the private practice of providing psychotherapy to clients. The discipline’s main organizational body of the time was the American Psychological Association, which came under pressure to allocate intellectual, organizational, and financial resources to the support of its practitioner members. One of the most intense battles of this period was that of creating different training models for clinical psychology. The early postwar model placed priority on training clinical psychology students to be scientists first, but by the 1960s, the demand for greater emphasis on training for practice had to be addressed for the field to remain coherent. Along with the internal tensions, psychology had to come to terms with external pressures as well. Among its challenges were those from competing professions, such as medicine, to its legal and cultural authority to provide professional services. Psychology eventually won those battles, but only after a state-by-state fight. Psychology was also presented with the challenges of a society wrestling with social problems, such as the demands for equal civil rights and opportunities.

Converging Parallels,Paul Bouissac,10.1177/0959354398086002,"This paper examines the interface between semiotics and psychology, first from the historical point of view of their parallel developments originating in late 18th-century philosophy, then from the theoretical perspective of contemporary evolutionary thinking.

However, the emergence of cognitive psychology during the second half of the 20th century provided new theoretical grounds for a potential dialogue. As the Darwinian revolution eventually recast many problems common to both semiotics and psychology in evolutionary terms, it is argued that these two parallel approaches to the study of mind, symbolic behaviour and meaning are bound to merge in the foreseeable future.

Recently, however, postmodern debates in the discipline have drawn attention to the construction of behaviour and experience in language organized through discourse.

Positive Psychology,"Dana Becker, Jeanne Marecek",10.1177/0959354308093397,"Positive psychology has figured itself as no less than a revolutionary reorientation of psychology, one that makes individual `flourishing' the primary object of study and intervention. There are clear comparisons to be made between this movement and earlier ones that have embraced both individualism and an ethos of adjustment, such as the popular mind cures of the late 19th century and the influential mental hygiene movement of the early 20th century. We argue for a focus beyond the individual in isolation, a perspective that takes in the totality of the social environment and an ethical stance that values social engagement and activism.

The Neglected Situation of Vision in Experimental Psychology,Aug Nishizaka,10.1177/0959354300105001,"The orthodox conception of `visual perception' entertained in cognitive psychology is that retinal images inside eyeballs or impressions in the `mind', which are very different from our actual visual experiences, are organized into a perception under an individual's skin.

In the main body of the paper an attempt is made to demonstrate how this orthodox conception is embodied in the actual course of interaction in psychological experiments.

Aggression,"Timothy Deckman, Richard S. Pond, C. Nathan DeWall",10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0087,"<p>Violence and aggression are prevalent across human cultures and daily life. One merely has to turn on the television or open an Internet browser to quickly gain access to violent images. For our early human ancestors, aggressive behavior had considerable adaptive value. For instance, aggression is useful for gaining access to precious resources, including food and shelter, and then protecting those resources once they are obtained. Aggression is also useful in gaining access to mates and protecting offspring. Therefore, aggression proved to be a good behavioral strategy for passing on one’s genes to subsequent generations. However, not all acts of aggression are adaptive. Humans depend on social groups for survival, therefore people must negotiate between antisocial and pro-social impulses. Aggression is particularly destructive in modern times, especially since it appears to be so ubiquitous in our everyday interactions. Thus, it remains a large area of study within the social sciences, especially among social psychologists. Psychologists employ a variety of research methodologies to study the causes and consequences of aggression, which groups are most at risk for aggressing against others, and how aggression can be reduced. In the following bibliography, we present general overviews on aggression, which introduce the prevailing psychological theories of aggression and review the research literature on the causes and consequences of aggression. We next present the research methods used by psychologists to study aggressive behavior.

Rethinking freedom for contemporary psychology,"Steffen Ernø, Rasmus Birk",10.1177/1354067x241226456,"The purpose of this paper is to rethink the topic of freedom for contemporary psychology. Freedom, within psychological research today, is a neglected, even slightly old-fashioned term. In this paper, we explore the practical, normative, and political dimensions of freedom as a psychological concept. We begin by tracing out key understandings of freedom from political theory, before discussing how thinkers such as Skinner, Maslow, Fromm, and May understood the different dimensions of freedom. We then discuss a governmental perspective on freedom, drawn from the work of Nikolas Rose, before finally turning to the sociocultural psychology of L. S. Vygotsky. We contend that freedom is not merely the absence of constraints but a complex interplay between agency, responsibility, and social connections. Our paper argues that the modern emphasis on negative freedom, characterized by reduced interference and obligations, has resulted in a paradoxical situation where individuals feel overwhelmed and seek escape from freedom. By revisiting the insights of Erich Fromm and other scholars, we emphasize the need for positive freedom, which involves voluntary connections with others and active participation in shaping society.

Another version regards it as an obvious reality, in that there is a substantial body of psychological literature that originates in the African context and is engaged with African issues and problems. This paper enters the debate by suggesting that African psychology is both myth and reality, conceived in the above terms. In doing this, it takes its lead from the West African philosopher of the human sciences, Hountondji. It goes on to explore the work of Fanon, the Algerian psychoanalytic theorist of colonialism, and Nsamenang, the developmental psychologist from Cameroon, as instances of psychologists whose work demonstrates that psychology in Africa should not be conceived of as unique to the continent, but rather as universal psychology engaged with the problems and issues of Africa. Above all else, the paper stresses that the debate is an African debate, actively engaged in by psychologists and philosophers in Africa, rather that one between Africans and some other, non-African tradition.",2002-3,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/008124630203200102,"There is in Africa (not least in South Africa) an important debate amongst psychologists, as amongst philosophers, concerning the possibility of an indigenous African psychology.

The Psychology of Authenticity,George E. Newman,10.1037/gpr0000158,"Perceptions of authenticity (or, inauthenticity) have been shown to affect people’s judgments and behavior across a wide variety of domains. However, there is still ambiguity about how the concept should be defined. This is attributable, at least in part, to a growing list of different “kinds of authenticity” with little discussion of the potential overlaps between them. The goal of this paper is to reduce these various notions of authenticity into a more manageable set of constructs. Building on the work of Newman and Smith (2016a), three broad kinds of authenticity are proposed: Historical, Categorical, and Values authenticity. Two studies then examine the extent to which people’s conceptions of authenticity naturally segment into these three types. Specifically, Study 1 asks participants about the various ways in which they might assess authenticity, whereas Study 2 examines individual differences in sensitivity to different kinds of inauthenticity. The results from both studies indicate a striking degree of convergence in support of these three broad dimensions. Moreover, different populations appear to be differentially concerned about these various ways of evaluating authenticity. The implications of this framework for existing and future work in this area are discussed.",2019-3,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1037/gpr0000158,"Perceptions of authenticity (or, inauthenticity) have been shown to affect people’s judgments and behavior across a wide variety of domains.

A hermeneutic perspective on dialogical psychology,Frank C Richardson,10.1177/1354067x11418544,"Leiman is surely right that Bakhtin's dialogism is of immense importance for psychotherapy research and psychology in general. Here I argue that Bakhtin's ideas represent an attractive third alternative to modern individualism and postmodern relativism. Philosophical hermeneutics also outlines such an alternative, one that richly complements Bakhtin's dialogism. Nevertheless, I suggest that some contemporary Bakhtinian theorists may veer too far in the direction of a radically decentered notion of the self.

Intelligent Design Psychology and Evolutionary Psychology on Consciousness: Turning Water into Wine,"Christopher R. Grace, J. P.

Some of these scientists promote the Intelligent Design movement, which has received recent attention from scholars in biology, biochemistry, mathematics, philosophy, and theology. Intelligent Design theory both challenges the naturalistic evolutionary account of life and proposes an alternative scientific research program. Its aim is to investigate the natural world for evidence of divine causes and to detect the patterns or fingerprints of an intelligent designer. The implications of this theory for the field of psychology are examined, and a new field, a Christian version of Intelligent Design Psychology (IDP<jats:sub>C</jats:sub>) is proposed.

Some of these scientists promote the Intelligent Design movement, which has received recent attention from scholars in biology, biochemistry, mathematics, philosophy, and theology. Intelligent Design theory both challenges the naturalistic evolutionary account of life and proposes an alternative scientific research program. Its aim is to investigate the natural world for evidence of divine causes and to detect the patterns or fingerprints of an intelligent designer. The implications of this theory for the field of psychology are examined, and a new field, a Christian version of Intelligent Design Psychology (IDPC) is proposed. The article then briefly compares the psychological implications of IDPC with its chief rival, a naturalistic version of evolutionary psychology (EPN), in relation to consciousness and self-consciousness, including why these phenomena provide serious difficulties for EPN, while at the same time providing positive support for IDPC. Both approaches are examined for their comparative abilities to describe, explain, and predict various facets of human persons that center on consciousness and self-conscious emotions."
Risk Perception and Social Factors Affecting Protective Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Iranian Sample,", Negar Sadeghi, Balal Izanloo, , Samaneh Dehghan Nezhad, , Maryam Emaminia, ",10.32598/jpcp.10.4.783.2,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of people worldwide. Considering that no specific pharmaceutical treatment exists for this disease, the best way to deal with it is through prevention. However, many people in the community do not implement preventive behaviors. The study investigates the risk perception of infectious diseases following psychological factors and social variables, such as age, gender, family structure, occupation, income, and saving as social factors.  Methods: A sample of 371 adults in the age range of 18 to 60 years (224 females and 147 males) was selected via the convenience sampling method from Karaj City. They answered questions about social variables, vulnerability to infectious diseases questionnaire, and questions about protective behaviors according to the World Health Organization protocol on COVID-19.  Results: The results showed that in the psychological dimension, self-risk assessment and vulnerability to infectious diseases can predict COVID-19-related preventive behaviors. In the social dimension, the family structure, gender, and familial and social relationships of individuals predicted protective behaviors in individuals.  Conclusion: prevention is essential for controlling the pandemic and it is necessary to consider the risk factors in every society.",2022-10-1,Negah Scientific Publisher,https://doi.org/10.32598/jpcp.10.4.783.2,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of people worldwide.

From Science to Therapy: The Shaping of German Psychology Through Student Preferences,Martin Wieser,10.1177/10892680241289906,"In 2020, a new record was set: For the first time in history, more than 100.000 students of psychology were officially enrolled in Germany. This remarkable number is the outcome of a long-term transformation of the whole academic landscape in Europe as well as dynamics that are specific to the German context. As these recent changes have not yet been properly discussed outside the German-speaking world, this paper provides a contextual analysis of the factors that have contributed to the current state of discipline, including legal regulations and economic conditions, academic curricula, and students’ preferences. It is argued that the growth of the discipline was primarily an effect of psychology becoming the primary route to psychotherapeutic practice in Germany after World War II. Even though representatives of the discipline repeatedly voiced concern about the one-sided interest of their students, German academic psychology has benefited from the steady increase in demand for clinical training, especially among female students, on many levels. In late 2020, a new law came into force which redefined the requirements for the qualification of psychotherapists. Although this legal reform was introduced only very recently, it is already becoming apparent that this change will have a profound impact on the discipline.

African psychology and the emergence of the Madiban tradition,Augustine Nwoye,10.1177/0959354317742204,"The recent welcome inclusion of the study of African psychology within the psychology degree curriculum of some forward-thinking African universities has been lauded as a great positive drive in the right direction.

Self-control and normativity: Theories in social psychology revisited,Dorothee Horstkötter,10.1177/0959354314561487,"The exercise of self-control is of great significance in people’s daily lives and in the organization of social institutions. The reasonableness of the self-control concept, however, has been challenged by recent developments in cognitive, behavioral, and neurosciences that identify human behavior as a result of complex automatic processes generated by people’s environments. Collating more data on self-control and developing new theoretical approaches is crucial to meeting this challenge. Still, this article argues that a conceptual analysis of the meaning of self-control is also needed. Reflecting on recent work in philosophy, it discusses how self-controlled behavior is characterized not only by distinct causal mechanisms, but also by fundamental normative evaluations. Four conceptualizations of self-control will be presented to highlight why the corresponding self-control failures are essentially also normative failures.

Unifying Psychology through Situational Realism,"Agnes Petocz, Nigel Mackay",10.1037/a0032937,"We propose that a coherent and thoroughgoing version of realism, known as situational realism, offers a unifying program for psychology. This realism emerges from the conditions of being that enable knowledge and discourse.

The approach is characterized by seven themes: ontological egalitarianism; situational complexity and process orientation; a network or field view of causality; a realist logic; a view of relations as nonconstitutive; an externalist relational approach to mind; and acceptance of critical inquiry as the core scientific method. The combination of these features offers psychology the following: a metatheoretical framework that resolves current tensions; expansion into the field of meanings and reintegration with hermeneutics and semiotics; clarification and redirection of mainstream cognitive neuroscience and information processing; an integrative approach to personality; expansion, redirection and unification of psychological research methods; and revision and expansion in psychological practice and teaching.",2013-6,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0032937,"We propose that a coherent and thoroughgoing version of realism, known as situational realism, offers a unifying program for psychology.

The combination of these features offers psychology the following: a metatheoretical framework that resolves current tensions; expansion into the field of meanings and reintegration with hermeneutics and semiotics; clarification and redirection of mainstream cognitive neuroscience and information processing; an integrative approach to personality; expansion, redirection and unification of psychological research methods; and revision and expansion in psychological practice and teaching."
Political Psychology as a Lens for Viewing Traumatic Events,Cheryl Koopman,10.1111/0162-895x.00081,"A burgeoning area of scientific inquiry uses psychological perspectives to understand traumatic events. This research has led to the identification of psychological symptoms and disorders frequently experienced in response to traumatic events. Many of the events having traumatic effects on large numbers of persons are of interest to political psychologists. Such events include the Holocaust, war, terrorism, captivity, torture, political migration, living as a political refugee, and assassination. Some interpersonal forms of trauma, such as rape and incest, also may be viewed with a political perspective. Although a number of studies have examined psychological consequences of political events, this area of inquiry is rarely explicitly considered within the domain of political psychology. Adopting an explicitly political psychology perspective on traumatic events may enrich our interdisciplinary understanding of these events and inform the design and evaluation of intervention programs to reduce psychological distress resulting from these events.",1997-12,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/0162-895x.00081,"A burgeoning area of scientific inquiry uses psychological perspectives to understand traumatic events.

Critical psychology &amp; education: Opportunities outside silos,"Tim Corcoran, Stephen Vassallo",10.1177/01430343231187064,"Many psychologists working in schools acknowledge how their work contributes to the reproduction and mitigation of societal injustices.

Evolutionary psychology: Neglecting neurobiology in defining the mind,Brad M.

Evolutionary psychology’s assumptions regarding our innate biology also shape their treatment of culture and learning in ways that may inaccurately reflect true experience–neurodevelopmental interactions.

Empathy and Altruism,"Eric L.

Feelings associated with empathy include sympathy, tenderness, and warmth toward the other person. Other manifestations of empathic emotions have been investigated, too, including empathic joy, empathic embarrassment, and empathic anger. As was the case with empathy, the term altruism has also been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including any type of prosocial behavior, as a collection of personality traits associated with helpful persons, and biological influences that evoke protective behaviors toward genetically related others. A particularly fruitful research tradition has focused on altruism as a motivational state with the ultimate goal of protecting or promoting the welfare of a valued other. For example, the empathy–altruism hypothesis claims that empathy (viewed here as an other-oriented emotional state) evokes an altruistic motivational state.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),Chris R. Brewin,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0094,"<p>Severe reactions to experiences such as combat and railway accidents have been described since the mid-19th century by numerous physicians, including Sigmund Freud and Pierre Janet. These descriptions include two types of characteristic symptoms: dissociative symptoms, in which there is a general disturbance in normal mental functions, such as memory, consciousness, time estimation, sense of reality, and identity, and reexperiencing symptoms, in which the traumatic event is vividly relived as though it were happening all over again in the present. Despite this early recognition, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was formally defined only in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-III (Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 1980). Prior to this, exposure to stress was assumed to produce only short-term problems in adjustment. In the DSM-III, PTSD required exposure to “a recognizable stressor that would evoke significant symptoms of distress in almost everyone” (p. 238) and was “outside the range of normal human experience” (p. 236). In addition four symptoms had to be present reflecting reexperiencing of the traumatic event, numbing and detachment, and a more pervasive change in arousal or emotions. The introduction of the disorder in the DSM-III was strongly influenced by studies of combat veterans and women in violent relationships, which suggested the existence of more long-lasting psychiatric conditions, variously termed “combat neurosis,” “rape trauma syndrome,” or “battered women syndrome.” The PTSD diagnosis was designed to subsume these syndromes and capture what was considered to be an essentially normal response to any overwhelming trauma. This made it unlike other psychiatric disorders, which all implied some vulnerability on the part of the person who succumbed to it. The definition was refined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-III-R published in 1987, which introduced more symptoms and required at least one reexperiencing symptom (e.g., intrusive memories or nightmares), three avoidance or numbing symptoms (e.g., avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event or loss of interest in activities), and two hyperarousal symptoms (e.g., exaggerated startle or irritability). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV, introduced in 1994, retained a similar structure. The 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5 increased the number of symptoms from seventeen to twenty and reorganized them into four symptom clusters, reexperiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. In 1992 PTSD also appeared in another major international classification system, the tenth edition of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 1992–1994). This formulation placed more emphasis on “episodes of repeated reliving of the trauma in intrusive memories (‘flashbacks’) or dreams” and also identified avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal as central features.

          Military psychology is most often assumed to mean the use of psychology in the effort to treat the wounds of war. However, this application is only the most visible aspect of a fertile and multifaceted field. Over the course of its history this discipline has expanded to the extent that it is now described as the application of all forms of psychology to the military context (Society for Military Psychology, 2009). Historically, the concept of “military context” was clearer. War was fought between two or more governments and, for the most part, it was fought by soldiers.

However, this application is only the most visible aspect of a fertile and multifaceted field. Over the course of its history this discipline has expanded to the extent that it is now described as the application of all forms of psychology to the military context (Society for Military Psychology, 2009). Historically, the concept of “military context” was clearer. War was fought between two or more governments and, for the most part, it was fought by soldiers. However, with the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) the scope of the military context has been stretched and psychological applications are rapidly stretching with it."
The Effectiveness of Group Schema Therapy-based Parenting Education of Mothers on Modifying Maladaptive Schemas of the Child and Improving the Quality of the Parent-Child Relationship,", Narges Sabzi, Azam Farah Bijari, , Zohre Khosravi, ",10.32598/jpcp.10.1.798.1,"Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of group schema therapy-based parenting education in modifying the child’s early maladaptive schemas and improving the parent-child relationship quality. Methods: This research is a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test-post-test design with a control group. The study’s statistical population includes all mothers and their daughters (8 to 10 years old, living in District 2 of Tehran City, Iran, who are students in 2020-2021). Among 65 mothers willing to participate in the study, 40 were selected by the available sampling method, according to the inclusion criteria. Then, they were randomly assigned to two groups of 20 people in the experimental and control groups. In this study, the schema inventory for children (by Rijkeboer &amp; De Boo) and the parent-child relationship scale (by Pinata) were used. The data of this study were analyzed by multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Results: Data analysis showed that parenting education had a significant effect on schemas of vulnerability, mistrust/abuse, failure, submission, unrelenting standards/hypercriticalness, self-sacrifice, and entitlement/grandiosity, but on the schemas of loneliness, defectiveness/shame, enmeshment/undeveloped self, and insufficient self-control/self-discipline had no significant effect.

Principles for a Cultural Psychology of Creativity,Vlad-Petre Glăveanu,10.1177/1354067x10361394,"This article focuses on a novel theoretical paradigm emerging in the study of human creativity: the cultural-psychological approach. It starts by differentiating between the long past of individualistic accounts of creativity (the lonely genius) and the short history of psychological understandings (the creative individual). The social and the cross-cultural psychology of creativity are both considered, together with their advantages and current limitations. Creativity is generally conceptualized as a process of artifact generation and five broad principles for a cultural psychology of creativity are presented. In clarifying the nature of creativity, a special consideration is given to the relationship between individuals, creativity, and culture.

Varieties of Theorizing and the Project of Psychology,Rom Harré,10.1177/0959354300010001599,"There are two kinds of explanation in the natural sciences. In one we attempt to create a representation of the unobservable processes and structures that are responsible for phenomena, the strong sense of explanation, and in the other we formalize a description of the phenomena in question.

In psychology there are already in existence a variety of psychologies used by people in different cultures to manage their lives. We have a variety of symbolic systems. Can we develop explanations in the second sense? We can start with the informal representation of the psychological bases of normative behaviour in sets of rules.

International Practices in School Psychology Training in Denmark,Kaj Spelling,10.1177/0143034385062004,"The first Scandinavian School Psychological Service was established in April 1934 in the municipality of Frederiksberg, which is an independent part of Greater Copenhagen.

Representation and emotion causation: A cultural psychology approach,Marc Clarà,10.1177/1354067x14568687,"This paper proposes a way of conceptualizing the role of representation in emotion causation from the perspective of Vygotskian cultural psychology.

It is argued that the kind of representation which mainly mediates emotion causation is what Vygotsky called perezhivanie, which, we suggest, is the same as what in the literature on emotion has been called appraisal. This position diverges from the two most widespread hypotheses on emotion causation: (1) representation causes feeling and emotion; and (2) representation enters the emotional process once feeling has already been caused by the environment.",2015-3,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/1354067x14568687,"This paper proposes a way of conceptualizing the role of representation in emotion causation from the perspective of Vygotskian cultural psychology.

Reference Points for Critical Theoretical Work in Psychology,Ian Parker,10.1177/0959354396063003,"Jost and Hardin's (1996) defence of Wittgenstein fails to address the ways in which that writer's texts function in different discursive contexts to warrant essentialist and relativist positions. The strategy of assembling bits of text from Wittgenstein and Marx to illustrate similarities of perspective is unconvincing, for it neglects the mobilization of theoretical arguments in the context of institutionally situated language-games or forms of life.

The Psychology of Legal Pedagogy: Introducing Interface between Law and Psychology,Dr K Parameswaran,10.25215/0301.036,"Law and psychology have a deep connection. Its connections come from various common elements between them. Three common elements that stand out among others bear a complementary impact between law and psychology. They are; ‘adherence’ to law and legal system by society, ‘understanding’ the needs of society by State Legislature, and finally pedagogical methods in legal education whereby legal ‘knowledge’ is transferred to law-students in society. All three common elements namely ‘adherence, understanding and knowledge’ have psychological dimensions affecting divergent roles and functions of law. However, the important role played by legal pedagogy among these three elements is crucial as legal ‘knowledge’ shapes the other two elements namely ‘adherence and understanding’. Legal knowledge when transferred through effective legal pedagogy enhances ‘adherence’ to law and legal system by society and ‘understanding’ for the State of its legislative duties.

Results show polar, coherent, stable, and potent ideological orientations only among the most knowledgeable 20–30% of citizens. That heterogeneity means full‐sample tests overstate ideology for most people but understate it for knowledgeable citizens. Whether through top‐down opinion leadership or bottom‐up ideological reasoning, organized political belief systems require political attention and understanding to form.

The article also exposes three mis-beliefs that seem to have helped dissuade many psychologists from taking advantage of evolutionary theory in their thinking and teaching.",1996-12,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1207/s15328023top2304_1,"The purpose of this article is to encourage teachers of psychology to make greater explicit use of evolutionary theory in their courses.

Control and resistance in the psychology of lying,Maarten Derksen,10.1177/0959354311427487,"Psychology’s obsession with control, with manipulating the experimental situation and the behavior of participants, has often been criticized. Mainstream, experimental psychology, it is said, abuses its power in the laboratory to artificially create docile participants who fit its experimental regime. I argue that this criticism accords too much control to the experimenter. Using the psychology of lying and lie detection as an example, I show that the psychologist does not exert full control in the laboratory, but meets resistance. In the psychological laboratory, lying and lie detection are constructed on a technological model in which both the psychologist and the liar are operators of devices, locked in battle. The critical focus, I conclude, should be on the technologies and counter-technologies at work on the laboratory, and on the limitations of this model.",2012-3-21,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354311427487,"Psychology’s obsession with control, with manipulating the experimental situation and the behavior of participants, has often been criticized.

I then apply this critical frame to a close reading of a clinical case discussed by Fanon in The Wretched of the Earth. As a psychiatrist, but also political revolutionary and psychoeducator, Fanon’s account is read here as indicative of his pedagogical address in motivating for sociopolitical as well as personal change and his therapeutic approach, albeit in need of a feminist re-reading of the gendering of violence, including sexual violence. The paper concludes by suggesting that Fanon’s psychoaffective analysis, first, indicates how resistance and transformation are simultaneously intrapersonal, interpersonal, and sociopolitical, but also that, second, attending to their shifting unstable and relational features works not only to renew and reinvigorate theoretical psychology but also the interventions and perspectives informing psychological and pedagogical activisms.",2016-8-1,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354316653484,"In this article I juxtapose three critical resources for theoretical psychology: Fanon, Foucault, and feminisms.

"Postmodern, Post-Cartesian Positionings on the Subject of Psychology",Mary Gergen,10.1177/0959354395053003,"Descartes's philosophical position, founded upon a mind/body dualism, has had a strong influence on psychology. His dualistic system has supported the creation of a discipline in which individuals are viewed both as systems affected by mechanistic bodily emanations and as self-regulating agents replete with self-awareness and the capacity for moral responsibility. The purpose of Harwood Fisher's (1995) paper is to demonstrate that this Cartesian view is crucial to the continuation of a psychological science, which has this form of being as its subject. The major antagonists of these goals are those involved in the postmodern move in psychology, and he focuses especially on the work of Kenneth Gergen, Rom Harré and John Shotter. My attempt here is to expose the manner in which Fisher masks his desire as reason, and to invite him to accept his desires as a foundationless, a priori commitment. Further I contend that possibilities other than chaos among faceless automatons can result from the erasure of the Cartesian legacy from psychological theory. On the contrary, my feminist postmodern reframing holds that a system that enforces a hierarchy within which the rational (mind/soul) elements are designated as the masters of the inferior body (emotions) reproduces the male/female dichotomy. This polarity, a hallmark of patriarchal history, is deeply problematic from the position of postmodern feminism.

(ii) Why has industrial psychology ignored the issues of labour for such a long time? Concerning the first question, it is suggested that most systems approaches to the study of industrial relations acknowledge a role for psychological investigation.

Keeping a course log (a type of journal), writing analyses of published articles, doing an observational study, and writing a formal research report are among the ideas presented. The techniques described here can be applied to any course in psychology and are not uniquely applicable to social psychology."
A tale of two explanatory styles in cognitive psychology,Lawrence Shapiro,10.1177/0959354319866921,"The development of a theory of mechanistic explanation has been a welcome advance over previous theories of explanation, such as deductive nomological explanation. However, despite the claims of some supporters of mechanistic explanation, not all explanation in cognitive science is or should be mechanistic. I defend the claim that functional analysis remains a distinct and legitimate form of explanation within cognitive science.",2019-8-1,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354319866921,"The development of a theory of mechanistic explanation has been a welcome advance over previous theories of explanation, such as deductive nomological explanation.

Psychology and the Art of Programme Evaluation,Charles Potter,10.1177/008124630603600106,"This article suggests that psychologists may find value in the literature on programme evaluation, both theoretically and methodologically. Programme evaluation is an eclectic and diverse field and its literature reflects the contributions of persons trained within a variety of disciplines. It draws on a number of fields, which include management and organisational theory, policy analysis, education, sociology, social anthropology and the literature on social change. As such, the literature on programme evaluation may have value for psychologists planning evaluations of social programmes, in providing access to evaluation approaches and models developed within these different traditions. In terms of the breadth of perspectives and research traditions on which the evaluation literature draws, different forms of evaluation research can contribute to a psychology in South Africa which deals with multiple values and issues. On a theoretical level, this article suggests that the issues and debates reflected in the evaluation literature (e.g., those on empowerment) mirror debates that have occurred within the mainstream of psychology over the past 20 years. For this reason, the issues raised in the evaluation literature are relevant to the development of psychology as a discipline. The approaches and models proposed for the evaluation of social programmes are also potentially useful on a methodological level, particularly to those psychologists who work in community settings.",2006-3,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/008124630603600106,"This article suggests that psychologists may find value in the literature on programme evaluation, both theoretically and methodologically.

Attraction in Close Relationships,Pamela C. Regan,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0158,"<p>Interpersonal attraction—liking or positive sentiment—plays a fundamental role in human life. The experiences we have and the outcomes we receive in virtually all areas of our existence—developmental, educational, occupational, social, relational, physical, and mental, to name a few—are deeply and continuously affected by the sentiments, feelings, and attitudes we evoke in others. Indeed, the answer to the question of who likes/dislikes us, who loves/hates us, or who is merely indifferent to us determines not only the personal, interpersonal, and social opportunities and outcomes we receive, but also the quality and even the quantity of our very lives. Although interpersonal attraction permeates and influences all human interactions and relationships, it plays a particularly important role in the formation and development of voluntary close relationships such as friendships and romantic relationships. Voluntary relationships typically are born within an open interaction field in which each potential partner is relatively free to initiate (or refrain from initiating) the relationship; consequently, the development and continued survival of these relationships is heavily dependent on the partners’ degree of attraction to one another. Thus, most theoretical and empirical work conducted on interpersonal attraction and relationship development—and virtually all work cited in this bibliography—is focused on voluntary relationships (and may not be applicable to nonvoluntary relationships [e.g., parent-child, coworker, arranged marriage]). The first section of this article introduces general review articles and books that summarize the scientific literature on interpersonal attraction and close relationship development. The second section focuses on theories of attraction and includes citations for the early models that focused primarily on attraction between strangers in lab settings, as well as more general process-oriented models that explain attraction in initial encounters and throughout subsequent relationship development. The third section presents research on the general factors that have been shown to generate liking and spark relationship initiation and development (e.g., familiarity, similarity, responsiveness, desirable partner attributes, physical attractiveness, proximity, receptivity).

Evolutionary Psychology,Daniel Paquette,10.1002/9780470672532.wbepp108,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          Evolutionary psychology focuses specifically on the evolution of the human mind. It has adopted as its own the basic theories of sociobiology, which itself is the product of the integration of ethology, ecology (population dynamics), and neo‐Darwinism. Ethology is the descriptive, causal, and comparative study of the behavior of animals (including humans) in their natural environment. Like psychology, ethology focuses as much on the external causes (trigger stimuli) as on the internal causes (nervous and endocrine mechanisms) of behavior, as well as on postconception development (ontogenesis). However, it analyzes animal and human behavior essentially from an evolutionary perspective. Ethology is thus also and primarily interested in so‐called distal or ultimate causes – that is to say, the evolution of behaviors in species over generations (phylogeny), and the biological functions of behaviors (i.e., their adaptive or survival value to individuals). Like organs, behavior is a means of adaptation to the environment and evolves primarily through the mechanism of natural selection (Darwin, 1859). Natural selection is the mechanism by which those individuals who have adapted least to the conditions of their environment (due to hereditary characteristics they may in turn pass on to their descendents) reproduce less than better adapted individuals. Over generations (i.e., thousands of years), differential reproduction and mortality ensure that certain characteristics become more widespread than others in a population. The discovery of the laws of heredity (Mendel) and molecular biology in the 20th century clarified the role of natural selection without fundamentally questioning it. Similarly, the work of certain anthropologists, psychologists, and biologists concerning the concept of cultural selection (culturally transmissible traits also offering reproductive advantages) has also contributed to our thinking about the mechanisms of human evolution.",2011-11-13,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470672532.wbepp108,"Abstract

Student Success in College,John H. Schuh,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0234,"<p>There are at least two dimensions of student success that have been explored widely in numerous studies. One dimension is that student success in college is defined as students’ achieving their goals upon embarking on their college career. Completing academic degree programs such as bachelor’s degrees, graduate degrees, or professional degrees (e.g., M.D., J.D., and so on) satisfactorily is a common characterization of student success. But not all students define success as completing a degree. Some students, for example, attend college with the goal of determining whether or not a baccalaureate degree program will help them achieve their educational or career goals. Accordingly, they enroll in college-level courses to determine if their educational goals can be met by completing a degree. Some students are enrolled in multiple institutions simultaneously, or they transfer from one institution to another, commonly known as swirling, to achieve their goals for their college experience. Another dimension of student success that has been widely studied has to do with what colleges and universities can do to provide an environment and develop programs and support so that students can achieve their goals for their college experience. This can be a combination of crafting an institutional environment that values and supports student success through a wide variety of messages, programs, and policies that, taken in the aggregate, communicate that it highly values student success and will do everything possible to help students succeed. The terms “persistence” and “retention” often are used synonymously, but for the purpose of this discussion, persistence refers to what students can do to achieve success, while retention is what institutions can do to help students achieve their educational goals. Programs, experiences, strategies, and other initiatives included in this discussion do not necessarily stand alone. That is, often they are complementary and have an effect on each other. There is considerable overlap in the topics considered in this article and in the Oxford Bibliographies in Education article Student Engagement in Tertiary Education because student engagement often is considered as a means by which success in college is achieved. In identifying and describing sources that address student success in college, the approach taken in this article is to consider the topic from the perspective of what institutions can do to facilitate student success and what students can do to achieve their educational goals. Many of the studies cited in this bibliography may be replicated in the future, perhaps with different methodological designs and most certainly with other groups of students. This edition of the bibliography has been designed to update the previous iteration, but it also has two additional emphases. The previous bibliography nearly exclusively focused on four-year institutions to the exclusion of community colleges and other two-year institutions. That was an oversight. IPEDS data indicate that while 10,938,123 undergraduate students were enrolled in four-year institutions in 2020, 4,913,783 were enrolled in two-year institutions (National Center for Education Statistics, Report on the Condition of Education 2022 [Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics, 2022]). The extent to which these students are successful in their educational endeavors is of great interest to higher education scholars, so many more citations are included related to students enrolled in two-year institutions than in the previous version. The other emphasis in this iteration is a natural progression in research on student success. In recent years researchers have taken a more nuanced view of programs and experiences designed to foster student success. For example, it has been widely asserted that first-year seminars provide an enriched experience for students leading to their persistence from year one to year two, and, accordingly, they have been part of the educational portfolio of many colleges and universities. Researchers, however, have parsed the focus of such seminars and have found that some first-year seminars have been more successful than others, depending on their focus. For example, those that are an extended form of orientation are not as potent as those that have an academic focus. Consequently, simply offering first-year seminars may not result in student success unless they have an academic focus.

Miller,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0322,"<p>The term theory of mind refers to beliefs about the mental world—to what people know or believe about beliefs, desires, emotions, and other mental states. Many basic forms of such understanding emerge early in development, and these early achievements have long been the most common focus of research on theory of mind. Development of theory of mind, however, is by no means complete by age five or six; rather, recent research documents a number of further developments that build on and extend the early forms of understanding. These further developments include understanding of second-order false belief (John thinks that Mary thinks . . . .), the capacity for higher-order recursive thinking (A thinks that B thinks that C thinks . . . .), understanding of interpretive diversity (two people may hold different beliefs about the same aspect of reality), understanding of opacity (the truth of some utterances depends on the utterance and not on the reality), the ability to interpret nonliteral utterances (e.g., lies, jokes, irony, sarcasm), and the ability to perceive the true emotion in instances of hidden or multiple emotions. Mastery of such knowledge typically extends across late childhood and adolescence, and, in some instances, even adults fall short of ceiling in their performance. Individual differences in understanding are, therefore, considerably more marked than is true in early childhood, and such differences have been shown to contribute to a number of other developments in both the cognitive and the social domains. This point holds true for typically occurring development, and it is often especially the case in clinical syndromes, most notably autism spectrum disorder or ASD. Theory of mind, including advanced theory of mind, is therefore of considerable pragmatic importance. Theory of mind also presents a number of important theoretical challenges, challenges that relate to central issues in developmental psychology. What is the nature of the underlying cognitive system that makes advanced theory-of-mind mastery possible? How does this system differ from the forms of knowledge available to the young child? And what are processes by which the initial system transforms into the advanced one? The sections to come will address these and other issues in the study of advanced theory of mind. In most instances the answers offered will be partial ones, and, therefore, needed directions for future research will be a continuing theme.</p>",2023-10-26,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0322,"The term theory of mind refers to beliefs about the mental world—to what people know or believe about beliefs, desires, emotions, and other mental states.

School Psychology and the Nigerian Cultural Situation,Shehu Ahmed Jimoh,10.1177/0143034386073004,"For more than 40 years, efforts have been made by successive governments as well as agencies, organizations and individuals in Nigeria to ensure the provision of adequate services for the psychological development of the Nigerian schoolchild. There is a department in the federal Ministry of Education charged with this specific function. Many psychologists and guidance counsellors have been trained to serve in schools. Test materials appropriate to school pupils have been produced. Seminars and workshops are frequently organized to examine some school-related adjustment problems. However, certain cultural factors that can impede school psychology services do not appear to have received adequate attention yet. Perhaps the most important of these is the average Nigerian's inadequate conception of causality, which makes him believe that his problems are always caused by things and people outside of himself. The recommendations put forward include the need to relate what goes on in school to the realities of life in the larger society outside school, and the need for an enlightenment programme aimed at developing in Nigerians a more scientific concept of causality.",1986-7,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0143034386073004,"For more than 40 years, efforts have been made by successive governments as well as agencies, organizations and individuals in Nigeria to ensure the provision of adequate services for the psychological development of the Nigerian schoolchild.

Does the History of Psychology Have a Future?,Kurt Danziger,10.1177/0959354394044001,"The history of psychology tends to be accorded a purely pedagogical role within the discipline rather than being seen as a possible source of substantive contributions. This reflects a type of mobilization of tradition that is characteristic of the natural rather than the human sciences.

However, there are developments which provide a more favourable context for critical historical scholarship.

Introduction: Theorizing the psychology of deglobalization,"Zhipeng Gao, Thomas Teo",10.1177/09593543221140874,"The unprecedented pace and scope of globalization over the past half century have had major impacts on the field of psychology.

We argue that the phenomenon of deglobalization is historically uncertain but intellectually and politically significant enough to warrant analysis. Thus, in this special issue, we begin to theorize the psychology of deglobalization by addressing several foundational issues: the major manifestations of deglobalization in relation to psychosocial life, the dialectical relations between globalization and deglobalization, and possible ways to respond to the challenges of deglobalization. In the meantime, we flesh out these theoretical perspectives using the cases of nationalism, neoliberalism, White supremacy, far-right politics, dehumanization, isolationism, and trade conflicts.",2023-4,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/09593543221140874,"The unprecedented pace and scope of globalization over the past half century have had major impacts on the field of psychology.

An Intellectual Renaissance of Humanistic Psychology?,Eugene Taylor,10.1177/0022167899392002,"A review is presented of the historical background of humanistic psychology, which flourished as a distinct movement roughly between the early 1940s to the late 1960s when it fractionated into transpersonal interests in meditation and altered states of consciousness, experiential therapeutics such as body work and the group encounter, and an ultraradicalized form of political psychology, and then became absorbed into the psychotherapeutic counterculture. Having entered a period of relative eclipse since then, its status today after 50 years is assessed. The case is made that humanistic psychologists could potentially launch a renaissance of the movement if they were to dissociate themselves from their present near-pathological focus on the transpersonal, the experiential, and the political long enough to reclaim their rightful place in the history of American academic psychology and then go on to capture the attention of the discipline of psychology with an entirely new metaphysics of how first-rate science should be conducted.",1999-4,SAGE Publications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022167899392002,"A review is presented of the historical background of humanistic psychology, which flourished as a distinct movement roughly between the early 1940s to the late 1960s when it fractionated into transpersonal interests in meditation and altered states of consciousness, experiential therapeutics such as body work and the group encounter, and an ultraradicalized form of political psychology, and then became absorbed into the psychotherapeutic counterculture.

Living and Doing Psychology,Jai B. P. Sinha,10.1177/097133360902200104,"As I look back at about 45 years of my research journey, I see three somewhat overlapping phases showing that my research has co-evolved with the way I have related to my milieu. The first 15 years witnessed my struggle to outgrow the alien framework by conducting research that, I thought, addressed the most salient socio-cultural issues in the Indian context with the methods that seemed to be the most appropriate. For the next 15 years, I tried to claim a legitimate space for my research on the international landscape.

Historiography in psychology: A note on ignorance,Daniel N. Robinson,10.1177/0959354313499426,"A persistent theme in books and essays concerning the history of psychology suggests something amiss in tracing that history to ancient sources. Authoritative writers on the subject reject any intimation of continuity from classical to modern perspectives. Nonetheless, writers of textbooks identify the ancient world of philosophy and science as wellsprings of issues still alive within the discipline. To some, this tendency is attributed to simple ignorance.

Residues of (Post-)Kantian Philosophy in Early Scientific Psychology and Hermann von Helmholtz’s Idealism,Liesbet de Kock,10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.674,"<p>German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) is widely acknowledged as one of the leading intellectuals and scientists of his time. Originally trained as a physiologist, Helmholtz contributed substantially to the fields of mathematics, physics, acoustics, ophthalmology, and the emerging science of psychology, amongst others. Not only did Helmholtz’s research interests cover a vast array of different topics, he furthermore paired his scientific endeavors with a continuous philosophical reflection upon the nature of science and knowledge, and of human cognition in general. Helmholtz’s philosophical interests were especially salient in his theory of perception, in which he attempted to reconcile his empirical viewpoint with insights derived from the idealist philosophies of Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. This dovetailing between empiricism and (transcendental) idealism has fascinated philosophers ever since the publication of Helmholtz’s work. Although Helmholtz famously rejected Kant’s theory of space, he considered his own theory of perception as a further elaboration and empirical confirmation of Kant’s and (to a lesser degree of) Fichte’s philosophical systems. Notwithstanding the abiding philosophical interest in the nature and extent of Helmholtz’s allegiance to German Idealism, the philosophical dimension of his work has not received the attention it deserves in the historiography of psychology. Revisiting Helmholtz’s intellectual relation to transcendental idealism, however, could not only help correct and enrich simplified accounts of his psychological and epistemological position, it furthermore provides a highly interesting illustration of the hitherto poorly understood relation between (neo-)Kantianism and the dawn of scientific psychology in 19th-century Germany.</p>",2019-10-30,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.674,"German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) is widely acknowledged as one of the leading intellectuals and scientists of his time.

Parents' Beliefs about Children,Scott A. Miller,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0317,"<p>What parents believe about children is one of the venerable topics in developmental psychology, with research dating back more than a century and publications numbering in the thousands. It is a topic that is by no means limited to psychology—numerous related disciplines bring their own perspectives to the study of parents and children. The reasons for interest are clear. Within psychology, the study of parents’ beliefs speaks to many of the central questions with which the science deals, questions of both theoretical and pragmatic importance. One is the nature of adult social cognition, that is, thoughts directed not to the inanimate world but to other people. For most parents, there is no more frequent target, and also no more important target, for social-cognitive efforts than one’s child. There may also be no more challenging target. Rearing a child may require dozens of decisions a day, often with little time to reflect and at times with a strong emotional accompaniment. Furthermore—and again in contrast to most instances of social cognition—the child presents a moving target, as the infant morphs into the toddler who morphs into the preschooler and so on up to adulthood. The result is that the study of parents’ beliefs, although it draws from the general literature on social cognition, also adds significantly to this literature. It adds as well to the literature on well-being and development in adulthood. Feelings about the self typically have many origins, but for parents few are as important as perceived success or perceived failure in the parenting role. Parents’ beliefs affect parents. Finally, and most critically, parents’ beliefs affect children. The relevant issue is again a long-standing one in psychology: Do beliefs lead to behavior—in this case, do parents’ beliefs affect how they treat their children? The answer is yes—not always, often not strongly, not necessarily as a sole cause of parental behavior, but as one cause. The study of parenting in fact provides the fullest evidence for a link between what we believe and what we do. It also provides clear evidence for the final link in the chain: Parents’ behavior affects children’s development. Parents are never a sole cause; all developments have a biological underpinning, and other social agents are often important. But parents’ beliefs and behaviors are one contributor to how children develop, and there is arguably no more important question to which psychology speaks.</p>",2023-8-22,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0317,"What parents believe about children is one of the venerable topics in developmental psychology, with research dating back more than a century and publications numbering in the thousands. It is a topic that is by no means limited to psychology—numerous related disciplines bring their own perspectives to the study of parents and children. The reasons for interest are clear. Within psychology, the study of parents’ beliefs speaks to many of the central questions with which the science deals, questions of both theoretical and pragmatic importance. One is the nature of adult social cognition, that is, thoughts directed not to the inanimate world but to other people. For most parents, there is no more frequent target, and also no more important target, for social-cognitive efforts than one’s child. There may also be no more challenging target.
